# About APIs override

Overriding of the apis will allow you to take full control of what happens when our frontend widgets call your backend.

> For most cases that involve modifying the default behaviour (without changing the input / output specification), you want to checkout [backend functions override](../backend-functions-override/about) instead.

### Example use cases:
- Post API callback for sending analytics or saving info in your db.
- Changing the input / output specification of the API to meet your requirements.
