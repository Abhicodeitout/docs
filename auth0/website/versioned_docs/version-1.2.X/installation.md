# Auth0 SDK Installation

This library provides a way to use SuperTokens with Auth0 with minimal changes to the frontend code.

### If using `auth0-spa-js`
```bash
npm i --save supertokens-auth0-spa-js@~1.2.0
```

### If using `auth0-react`
```bash
npm i --save supertokens-auth0-react@~1.2.0
```

### If using `auth0-js`
We do not support integration with this SDK as of yet.

----------------

**You will also need to make small changes to your backend APIs as described in the Auth0 section for the backend SDK code.**
