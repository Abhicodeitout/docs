# Introduction

This guide explains all the ways that SuperTokens can assist in authentication between microservices:
- User ID / session based authentication
- User independent authentication

## Auth flow
When microservice `M1` wants to talk to microservice `M2`, `M1` will start by creating a JWT (by contacting the SuperTokens core), and pass that JWT to `M2`.

`M2` will then verify the JWT and check that it's created by a service that is allowed to talk to it, and only then proceed with serving the request.

:::note
This approach allows you to build a zero trust environment between your microservices in a way that even if they are all open to the internet, they will only be queryable by each other.

In the next section, we will be showing you how to create a JWT using SuperTokens, and then after that, we will be explaining specific use cases for microservice auth.
