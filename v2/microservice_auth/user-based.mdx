# User ID based auth

This method is appropriate when a user who is logged in, sends a request to your app's backend which needs to talk to other backend services in order to form and send a reply. 

An example of this is an API that returns all the profile information for a user (let's say for a social media app). This API needs to talk to different microservices to fetch various parts of the user's profile - bio info, friend's list, and profile posts. Each of these pieces of information are managed by separate microservices.

The steps this API will take are:
- [Verify the user's session](https://supertokens.com/docs/session/common-customizations/sessions/session-verification-in-api/verify-session)
- [Create a JWT](./jwt-creation) containing the userID, session handle (optional) and the *ID for the current microservice*.
- Send the request to the various microservices with the JWT.
