# Overview

The [core service](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core) is a Java based http service that is stateless and concurrently safe.

By stateless, we mean that one can spin several instances of the core and sending a request to any one of them is alway identical to sending the same request to another one of them.

By concurrently safe, we mean that it is thread safe, as well as multi-process safe. This means that if an operation is not idempotent (like signing up a new user based on their email), doing that operation in parallel across different cores should have the same effect that these operations were instead run in a sequence. This in turn implies that we will have to use mutex locking with a core, or db transactions (with row level locking), or some concensus algorithm, or some distributed locking system.
