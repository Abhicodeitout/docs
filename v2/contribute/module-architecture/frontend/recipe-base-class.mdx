# About `RecipeModule` and `AuthRecipeModule`

`RecipeModule` is the abstract base class that all recipes (their `recipe.ts` file) must implement, and `AuthRecipeModule` is the abstract class the extends `RecipeModule` and all auth recipes must implement.

An auth recipe is a recipe that has user sign up / sign in (they create their own user). So emailpassword is an auth recipe, whereas session is not an auth recipe. So emailpassword extends `AuthRecipeModule` and session directly extends `RecipeModule`.

## What does `RecipeModule` do
- All recipes might need to redirect users based on some `context` object. So we have a function `getDefaultRedirectionURL` that a child recipe class can implement to take care of redirection.
- The base class also contains some common helper method related to redirecting a user.
- A recipe may have a feature in which case get can implement the `getFeatures` and `getFeatureComponent` functions. A feature is a part of a recipe that has it's own UI and is displayed based on some rule.
- This class also holds some config values that are common for all recipes. The config contains:
   - `recipeId`
   - `appInfo` (containing the `appName`, `websiteDomain`, `apiDomain`..): These can be used by the recipe's logic as and when needed.
   - User hook functions: `getRedirectionURL`, `preAPIHook` and `onHandleEvent`.
   - `useShadowDom`: If this recipe should use the shadow dom or not.
   - `palette`: For colour styling.
- Finally, since all recipes extend this class, we can use this class as a type in the user's config input for `recipeList`.

## What does `AuthRecipeModule` do
- It adds the email verification recipe to this recipe - since all auth recipes (as of this writing) have an email and the user should be able to verify the email.
- Provides some common helper functions for the recipe's logic to use:
    - `signOut`
    - `doesSessionExist`
    - redirection to auth screen
- Handles redirection to the sign up / in screen and to post sign in / up screen.
