# How session interception works

The session recipe is in the [supertokens-website](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-website) repo.

It works on the basis of adding interceptors to `fetch` and `axios` instances. In a nutshell, it:
- Before sending a request: Adds anti-csrf token measures if necessary.
- After the response:
    - If a new session is created, it saves the various tokens in the frontend cookies.
    - If a session is revoked, it removes those tokens from the frontend cookies.
    - If a refresh is required, it calls the refresh API and then retries the original request.

It also provides ways to check if a session exists, get the access token payload on the frontend, and to sign out.
