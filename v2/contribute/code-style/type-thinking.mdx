# Type Thinking

Before starting to code a API / class / function, we must be very clear on what the types involved are. For example:
- For classes, we must first understand what the instance variables are, what are their types are and what operations would be allowed on them.
- For functions, we must be very clear on what the input and output types are.
- For an API, we must be very clear on what the input and output types are.

Only after all the types are confirmed, we must start coding. This has the benefit that it gives you a lot of clarity in thinking (in terms of thinking of edge cases) and makes coding easier. It also makes reviewing easier.
