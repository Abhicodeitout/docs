# Golang

- Use pointers when:
   - Need to pass by reference
   - Need to make something optional

- When returning an object from an API or recipe function, and if the object has different status types, each status type should correspond to a nullable sub-object. For example, if the return type of a function is:
   ```ts
   {status: "OK", name: string} | {status: "SOME_ERROR"}
   ```
   This should be like the following in go:
   ```go
   type Response struct {
      OK *struct{
         Name string
      },
      SomeError *struct{}
   }
   ```
   Then the consumer of the function can check if `response.OK != nil` or `response.SomeError != nil`

- When parsing JSON response from an API, one method is to first marshall it (convert it to string JSON) and then unmarshall it into an object.
