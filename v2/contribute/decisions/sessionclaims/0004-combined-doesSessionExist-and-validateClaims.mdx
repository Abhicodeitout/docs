# Only add validators in REQUIRED mode in the email verification recipe

## Context and Problem Statement

The new `hasAccess` function (see [this](./0002) decision) would return `hasAccess: false` for a session with an unverified email even in OPTIONAL mode (and always in web-js) currently.

## Considered Options

* Add `invalidClaims` to the `hasAccess: true` return type of `hasAccess`
* Only add validators in REQUIRED mode in the email verification recipe

## Decision Outcome

We should only add validators in REQUIRED mode in the email verification recipes, because:
- `hasAccess: true` with invalid claims seems a bit weird.
- It would complicate claims further if we allowed them to only optionally disallow access.

As a consequence:
- We should add `mode` param to the email verification recipe in web-js.
- In both SDKs, the OPTIONAL mode should not add the email verification claim to the global claim validators.
