# Claim redirection functions should return full urls

## Context and Problem Statement

We have decided to use configurable callbacks to redirect on claim validation success/failure (see [here](./0001)). These functions determine where we redirect the user by returning a string. We have to decide if this string is a full URL or just a path

## Considered Options

* Path
* Full URL

## Decision Outcome

The return value should be taken interpreted as a full URL (with the option to return just the path for local redirections):

- For most sites, where there is session sharing between subdomains, this doesn't matter.
- It makes sense for `onFailure` to redirect to the website domain in many cases (e.g: email verification check failing)
- There are cases, where `onFailure` doesn't point to the website domain, e.g.: the access denied page is specific to the app/subdomain we are currently on
- `onSuccess` is even more likely to redirect to a domain that doesn't match the websitedomain (e.g: continue browsing after email verification/2FA on websitedomain)
- Even if we could make onFailure redirect only to the website domain, doing the same to `onSuccess` would block too many usecases (or cause awkward double redirections).
- Making them inconsistent would be bad.
