# Reserve scopes starting with `supertokens.`

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2023-05-11" created="2023-05-11" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

When creating scopes we can choose what to allow and/or reserve for special use

## Considered Options

* Reserve some scopes
* Allow all scopes

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Reserve some scopes (scopes starting with `supertokens.` + `openid`), because

* It's future-proof
* Doesn't block any usecase

Some scopes we've decided to reserve:
* `openid`: this scope will add the id token to the token response. should be always allowed for all clients
* `supertokens.profile`: access to email address (+ verification status), phone number and third party provider information
* `supertokens.roles`: access to role information 
* `supertokens.permissions`: access to permission information

Based on the above scopes we will:
- Add information mainly into the id token
- Make this information available through the access token calling a user info endpoint
- Not add these to the access token (although we will allow that to be customizable)
- Do not add any information outside of the user id (and sessionHandle) without an appropriate scope, since adding PII should always be opt-in.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Reserve some scopes

<ArgumentPro> Future-proof: If we require them in the future we can be sure noone conflicts with it </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentPro> Shouldn't block any usecase - when setting up, they can just choose a different prefix </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> Added docs (but fairly minimal) </ArgumentCon>

### Allow all scopes

<ArgumentPro> Very easy to communicate </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> Can create problems if we need to use them ourselves </ArgumentCon>
