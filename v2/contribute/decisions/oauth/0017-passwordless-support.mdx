# Only document issues with passwordless in first iteration

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2023-05-11" created="2023-05-11" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

Using magic links in OAuth2 has some problems with our current pwless implementation:
- Opening the link on a separate device will not log the original tab in, stopping the user from logging in.
- Opening the link in a new tab will cause the original tab to display a screen telling the user to close it and the new tab redirects the user back to the client.

## Considered Options

* Provide better support by modifying the pwless recipe
* Document the issues and provide better support in future iterations
* Disable using passwordless in OAuth2

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Document the issues and provide better support in future iterations

* No need to modify other recipes for now - we want to provide OAuth2 support ASAP
* We want to provide proper support for this in the future
* The user can still choose to disable this for themselves (i.e.: not use this recipe)

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Provide better support by modifying the pwless recipe

<ArgumentPro> Better UX </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> Requires modifying other recipes, delaying OAuth2 support </ArgumentCon>

### Document the issues and provide better support in future iterations

<ArgumentPro> Less work required before OAuth2 can be supported </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> Not great UX in some cases </ArgumentCon>

### Disable using passwordless in OAuth2

<ArgumentPro> No UX issues </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentPro> Less work required before OAuth2 can be supported </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> The user can choose to disable this themselves </ArgumentCon>
<ArgumentCon> Not great DX </ArgumentCon>
