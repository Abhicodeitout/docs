# Store the original query params creating the tokens/code

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2023-05-11" created="2023-05-11" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

To support certain OIDC features, we'd need to add new columns to the tokens/auth code table.
One example is `nonce` using the authorization code flow:
- we would need to reflect the `nonce` added to the request creating the auth code in the id token
- the id token is created by the later tokens call in this flow by which time we do not have access to the original query params

## Considered Options

* Add a separate column for each type of query param
* Store the original query params creating the tokens/auth code

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Store the original query params creating the tokens/auth code

* Simplifies Core implementation
* Choosing to support new features later doesn't involve DB change

### Further details

- A new column/prop is added into authorization codes and access tokens + related responses
- This will contain all the query params that were used when creating the auth code (if using auth code flow) or the queryparams used when creating the tokens using client credentials

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Add a separate column for each type of query param

<ArgumentPro> No duplicate information stored </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> It could require future DB changes and/or adds potentially unused columns into the DB </ArgumentCon>

### Store the original query params creating the tokens/auth code

<ArgumentPro> Simplifies Core implementation </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentPro> Choosing to support new features later doesn't involve DB change </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> Some information is stored twice - this is also solveable if necessary </ArgumentCon>
