# Token payloads and lifetimes are regenerated on the BE for refresh

## Context and Problem Statement

When issuing tokens using a refresh token, we need to decide where we get the payloads and lifetimes from.

## Considered Options

* Token payloads and lifetimes are regenerated on the BE for refresh
* They are re-used from when the tokens where first issued

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Token payloads and lifetimes are regenerated on the BE for refresh

* Refreshing ensures fresh information
* Simple to explain: the token is always built using the same callbacks

As a sub-decision, we've discussed adding an endpoint to load the information needed for these callbacks vs adding them into the token (kind of like a JWT):

* Making it a JWT would make the token much bigger
* The overhead of the extra call shouldn't matter too much, since this is not an often used operation (e.g.: 1/hr/user)
* Parsing the JWT would complicate things unnecessarily

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Token payloads and lifetimes are regenerated on the BE for refresh

<ArgumentPro> Refreshing ensures that the information in the tokens is fresh as well </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentPro> The token payloads and lifetimes are always controlled by the same callbacks on the BE </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> Requires an additional endpoint and a multiple step process to refresh tokens </ArgumentCon>
<ArgumentCon> Some information could be safely re-used from the old payload, but we are re-getting them anyway </ArgumentCon>

### They are re-used from when the tokens where first issued

<ArgumentCon> The tokens can contain stale information </ArgumentCon>
