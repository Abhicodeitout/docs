# Store a global list of scopes that can be enabled per client

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2023-05-11" created="2023-05-11" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to add a list of enabled scopes to each client.

## Considered Options

* Directly store the list of enabled scopes in each client
* Store a global claim list and reference it in clients

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Store a global claim list and reference it in clients

* Prevents typos

### Notes

- As per [this decision](./0005), there are some reserved scopes, and a default `openid` scope. 
- The "openid" scope will be allowed by default for all clients without adding it manually (and keeping it if it was added manually)
    - It'll not be added however to tokens/auth codes if the user hasn't requested this scope

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Directly store the list of enabled scopes in each client

<ArgumentPro> Creating and enabling scopes is a single step </ArgumentPro>

### Store a global claim list and reference it in clients

<ArgumentPro> Prevents typos when creating multiple clients </ArgumentPro>
