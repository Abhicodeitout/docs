# Use account linking if using ST as a third-party provider

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2023-05-11" created="2023-05-11" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

We will provide support for using ST as a provider in the ThirdParty (and combination) recipes. Ideally, we'd like to re-use the user id we have in the original.

## Considered Options

* Use user id mapping
* Use account linking

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Use account linking if using ST as a third-party provider

* Doesn't require using separate apps (as in multitenancy) for the provider and the consumer.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Use user id mapping

<ArgumentCon> Requires using separate apps (as in multitenancy) for the provider and the consumer. (We can't map to an existing user id) </ArgumentCon>

### Use account linking if using ST as a third-party provider

<ArgumentPro> Fits the use-case exactly </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> Not done yet. </ArgumentCon>
