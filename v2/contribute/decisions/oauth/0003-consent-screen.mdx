# No built-in consent screen at first

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2023-05-11" created="2023-05-11" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

While not strictly required most OAuth2 implementations include a consent screen.

## Considered Options

* Build consent screen in the first version
* No built-in consent screen at first
* No built-in consent screens

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: No built-in consent screen at first, because

* We can get initial support earlier
* We can ensure future versions will not need migration

What we need store to enable this in the future:
- enabled scopes (per client):
    - required anyway
- auto allowed scopes (per client):
    - these scopes are allowed ("consented to") by default for every user, meaning 
    - in the future these will be the scopes that cannot be disabled on the consent screen
    - required/optional scopes can be described in the authorization request

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Build consent screen in the first version

<ArgumentPro> No migration needed later </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentPro> Starts with full support </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> Delays initial iteration </ArgumentCon>

### No built-in consent screen at first

<ArgumentPro> No migration needed later </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentPro> Earlier initial iteration </ArgumentPro>

### No built-in consent screen support

<ArgumentPro> Earlier initial iteration </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> Doesn't support a main use-case (or could need migration in the future) </ArgumentCon>
