# Recipe selection for pre-built UI

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-12-08" created="2022-12-08" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "sattvikc"]} proposedBy={["sattvikc"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

In case of `usesDynamicLoginMethods` set to true, the backend responds with the recipes that are enabled in the core for a particular tenant, such as:
```json
{
  "thirdParty": {
    "enabled": true/false,
    ...
  },
  "emailpassword": {
    "enabled": true/false,
    ...
  },
  "passwordless": {
    "enabled": true/false,
    ...
  }
}
```

Along with this, the user would have statically initialized a combination of auth recipes, such as emailpassword & thirdpartypasswordless, etc.

Based on the information provided by backend (core) and the recipies initialized by the user, the SDK needs to decide which recipes must be used for the UI

## Considered Options

* Logic described below

## Decision Outcome

### Step 1 Find an exact match (more examples later)

The SDK will first try to find if there is an exact match between the recipies initialized in the frontend and the recipies enabled in the core.

For example, if thidparty and emailpassword is enabled in the core and the user has initialized thirdpartyemailpassword recipe on the frontend, that will be used.

### Step 2 Find a partial match (more examples later)

If the Step 1 has failed, the SDK will try to find and pick matching recipes and then use that for the UI, in the following priority order:

* thirdpartyemailpassword
* thirdpartypasswordless
* emailpassword
* passwordless
* thirdparty

For example, if thirdparty and emailpassword is enabled in the core and the user has initialized emailpassword & thirdpartypasswordless recipe on the frontend, thirdpartypasswordless with passwordless disabled and emailpassword would be picked, based on the priority order.

Note if all recipes can't be found, the SDK will not throw error, instead it will use the partially matched recipes to present the UI.

### Step 3

If the Step 2 also fails, the SDK will throw an error, as there is no match at all.

For example, if thirdparty and emailpassword is enabled in the core and the user has initialized passwordless recipe on the frontend, it will result in an error.

## Pros and Cons

<ArgumentPro> Presents best matched UI </ArgumentPro>

## Examples and results

| Recipes Enabled in Core | Recipes initialized on frontend | Selected Recipe for UI |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------ | :--------------------- |
| emailpassword           | emailpassword                   | emailpassword          |
| thirdparty              | thirdpartyemailpassword         | thirdpartyemailpassword |
| thirdparty & emailpassword | thirdpartyemailpassword      | thirdpartyemailpassword |
| thirdparty & emailpassword | thirdparty & emailpassword   | thirdparty & emailpassword |
| thirdparty & emailpassword | thirdparty & passwordless    | thirdparty             |
| thirdparty & emailpassword | emailpassword & thirdpartyemailpassword | thirdpartyemailpassword |
| thirdparty & emailpassword | emailpassword & thirdpartypasswordless | thirdpartypasswordless with passwordless disabled & emailpassword |
| thirdparty & emailpassword & passwordless | thirdpartyemailpassword & thirdpartypasswordless | thirdpartyemailpassword & thirdpartypasswordless with thirdparty disabled |
