# Implicit initialization of Multitenant recipe

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-12-08" created="2022-12-08" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "sattvikc"]} proposedBy={["sattvikc"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

All the dynamic config management functions are exposed from the Multitenancy recipe.

Should the Multitenancy recipe be implicitly initialized by the SDK, or explicitly initialized by the user, for the user or the SDK to be able to use those functions?

## Considered Options

* Multitenancy recipe is initialized explicitly by the user
* Multitenancy recipe is initialized implicitly by the SDK


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Multitenancy recipe is initialized implicitly by the SDK**, because

On the backend:
* Allows the usage of the config management functions in the Multitenancy recipe without having to initialize it. So implementation of other recipes would be simpler - they can assume this recipe is available and check if they should be enabled or not as opposed to first checking if the recipe is initialised and then using it.

On the frontend:
* When user is using dynamic config for a single tenant, the SDK requires Multitenant to be initialized to be able to fetch the dynamic config from the backend. Initializing implicitly gets the functionality to the user without any new configuration.

*Note for Backend: The user can still explicitly initialize the recipe in case the recipe functions needs overriding.*

*Note for Frontend: The user will need to explicitly initialize the recipe in case of a multi-tenant setup, to be able to provide the tenantId*

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Multitenancy recipe is initialized explicitly by the user

<ArgumentCon> Additional config for the user </ArgumentCon>

### Multitenancy recipe is initialized implicitly by the SDK

<ArgumentPro> Dynamic config management functions are available by default </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentPro> No additional config for the user, in case of single tenant / dynamic config </ArgumentPro>
