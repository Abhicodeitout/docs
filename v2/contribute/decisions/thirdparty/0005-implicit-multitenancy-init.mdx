# Implicit initialization of Multitenant recipe

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-12-08" created="2022-12-08" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "sattvikc"]} proposedBy={["sattvikc"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

All the dynamic config management functions are exposed from the Multitenancy recipe.

Should the Multitenancy recipe be implicitly initialized by the SDK, or explicitly initialized by the user, for the user or the SDK to be able to use those functions?

## Considered Options

* Multitenancy recipe is initialized explicitly by the user
* Multitenancy recipe is initialized implicitly by the SDK


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Multitenancy recipe is initialized implicitly by the SDK**, because

### On the backend:
* Allows the usage of the config management functions in the Multitenancy recipe without having to initialize it. So implementation of other recipes would be simpler - they can assume this recipe is available as opposed to first checking if the recipe is initialised and then using it.

:::note

The user can still explicitly initialize the recipe in case the recipe functions needs overriding.

:::

### On the frontend:
* Since the Multitenacy is implicitly initialized, and the dynamic config is handled by this recipe, for the Single tenant / Dynamic config use case, the user configuration is simplified to just enabling `usesDynamicLoginMethods`.

:::note

The user will need to explicitly initialize the recipe in case of a multi-tenant setup, to be able to provide the tenantId

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Multitenancy recipe is initialized explicitly by the user

<ArgumentCon> Additional config for the user in case of Single Tenant / Dynamic config </ArgumentCon>

### Multitenancy recipe is initialized implicitly by the SDK

<ArgumentPro> Frontend: Other recipes can use the tenant id provided by Multitenancy recipe, without having to check if it has been initialized </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentPro> Frontend: User need not initialize Multitenancy recipe manually, in case of single tenant / dynamic config </ArgumentPro>
