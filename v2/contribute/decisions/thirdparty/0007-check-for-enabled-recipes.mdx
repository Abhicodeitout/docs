# Should recipe check for enabled recipes in the core

## Context and Problem Statement

Multitenancy recipe now supports enabling and disabling of recipes per tenant. But the recipes are also initialized statically in the Supertokens init.

Should each of the recipe check if the recipe is enabled in the core?

## Considered Options

* Recipe should not check
  * API Should not check
  * Functions should not check
* Recipes should check
  * API should check
  * Functions should not check

Reason why we don't check in the functions because it allows the user to use the functions even if that recipe is not enabled for that tenant, and is not exposed to pose security risk. However, API check would need to be considered as it is publicly exposed.


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Recipes should check**, because

* This will ensure consistency in behaviour as per user configuration and SDK behaviour

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Recipes should not check

Recipes APIs don't check for this flag, and, all the statically configured recipes will function as defined, even if the user has disabled them in the core.


<ArgumentCon> Inconsistent SDK behaviour with the user configuration. For example, a user might be able to create an emailpassword account and use the application, which a particular tenant intends to disable, just because it was statically declared for use with a different tenant. </ArgumentCon>

### Recipes should check

The recipe APIs check if the recipe is enabled in the core and then continue it's execution


* Checks are performed in the recipe APIs as it is public facing and pose security risk
* Checks are not performed in the recipe functions as they are not public facing and are only used internally

<ArgumentPro> Consistent SDK behaviour with the user configuration </ArgumentPro>
