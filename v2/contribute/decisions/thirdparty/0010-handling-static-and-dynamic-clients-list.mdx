# Handling statically and dynamically configured clients list for each provider

## Context and Problem Statement

For each provider, we allow a list of clients to be configured. Each client refers to the credentials to be used with a particular `clientType`, such as web, mobile, etc.

When a provider is declared statically in the code and also add in the core, we now have to lists of clients. How do we consolidate it?

## Considered Options

* Use the clients list from the core
* Merge the static list and the list from the core using `clientType`


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Merge the static list and the list from the core using `clientType`**, because

* Avoids duplication of shared credentials

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Use the clients list from the core

In this approach, we just ignore the clients list in the static config and just use the list from the core.

<ArgumentCon> Clients list must be duplicated in core for each tenant, even if using the same set of client configs across several tenants. </ArgumentCon>


### Merge the static list and the list from the core using `clientType`

In this approach, we start with the static clients list and do the following:

For each client config in the core, we check if there is a client config with the same `clientType` in the static list. If there is, we replace the entire client object with the one coming from the core. If there is no client config with the same `clientType`, we add the client config from the core to the list.

<ArgumentPro> Can declare unchanging clients list in the code and add the changing ones in the core </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentNeut> We may end up with extra clients from the static list, which may not be used by a particular tenant </ArgumentNeut>

** Example **

if the static config has following clients:

```json
{
  thirdPartyId: "google",
  clients: [
    {
      clientType: "web",
      clientId: "clientid1",
      clientSecret: "clientsecret1"
    },
    {
      clientType: "mobile",
      clientId: "clientid2",
      clientSecret: "clientsecret2"
    },
  ]
}
```

and the core has the following clients, for a particular tenant:

```json
{
  thirdPartyId: "google",
  clients: [
    {
      clientType: "web",
      clientId: "clientid_tenant1",
      clientSecret: "clientsecret_tenant1"
    },
  ]
}
```

The consolidated clients list use would be:

```json
{
  thirdPartyId: "google",
  clients: [
    {
      clientType: "web",
      clientId: "clientid_tenant1",
      clientSecret: "clientsecret_tenant1"
    },
    {
      clientType: "mobile",
      clientId: "clientid2",
      clientSecret: "clientsecret2"
    },
  ]
}
```
