# Validation of AdditionalConfig of a provider config in the core

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-12-08" created="2022-12-08" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "sattvikc"]} proposedBy={["sattvikc"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

Should the additionalConfig (provider specific) (such as `hd` for google workspaces, `keyId`, `teamId` etc for apple) validated in core, while adding or updating them?

## Considered Options

* Yes, Validate in core
* No provider specific validation in core


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Yes, Validate in core**, because

* Reduces run time error by ensuring that the correct config is added to the database
* No major drawback of this approach

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Yes, Validate in core

This means that the core will validate the provider specific additionalConfig, before saving in the database. Also, adding a `noVerify` flag to the core API to let the user skip the validation.

<ArgumentPro> Reduces run time error by ensuring that the correct config is added to the database </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentNeut> If core is not upgraded, configs for newly supported providers will not be validated. This is equivalent to the other option under consideration and doesn't prove to be a major disadvantage </ArgumentNeut>

### No provider specific validation in core

<ArgumentPro> Lesser development effort </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> Likely to cause more run time errors due to invalid configs stored in the core </ArgumentCon>
