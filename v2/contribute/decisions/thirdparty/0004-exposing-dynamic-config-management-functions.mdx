# Multitenancy as a separate recipe

## Context and Problem Statement

To support the management of dynamic config, such as thirdparty provider list for each tenant, SDK must expose a set of management functions, to create, update, etc. 

These functions are specific to each recipe. As an example, for thirdparty, we would need functions like:

- createOrUpdateThirdPartyProviderConfig
- deleteThirdPartyProviderConfig
- so on

Should these functions be exposed from individual recipes or a common `Multitenancy`` recipe?


## Considered Options

* Exposed via individual recipes
* Exposed via **Multitenancy** recipe


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Exposed via Multitenancy recipe**, because

* Avoids duplication of the management functions. For example, thirdparty and thirdpartyemailpassword would expose same set of functions for the config management.
* Enables multi-tenancy to be expanded to other recipes in future, as it would be one place to add more management functions


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Exposed via individual recipes

<ArgumentCon> Causes duplication or rework while expanding the functionality to other recipes </ArgumentCon>

### Exposed via **Multitenancy** recipe

<ArgumentPro> One place to expose functions for multi-tenant config management </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentPro> Easily expand functionality to other recipes without function duplication </ArgumentPro>
