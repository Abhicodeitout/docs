# Initial state of default tenant in core

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-10-25" created="2022-10-25" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

Since the recipe APIs query the core if the recipe is enabled in core,
what is the desired initial state of default tenant in the core?

## Considered Options

* Do not create a default tenant in core, assume all recipes are enabled if config not found
* Do not create a default tenant in core and assume no recipes are enabled by default.
* Create a default tenant in core with all recipes (emailpassword, passwordless and thirdparty) enabled


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Create a default tenant in core with all recipes enabled**, because

* Best user experience with statically configured recipes
* Recipe APIs can check if the recipe is enabled without having to handle the corner cases

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Do not create a default tenant in core, assume all recipes are enabled if config not found

<ArgumentPro> Better user experience with statically configured recipes, as they will work as expected </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentCon> When a config is not found, recipes would have to allow in case of default tenant and deny for other tenants, which is an unnecessary extra check. </ArgumentCon>


### Do not create a default tenant in core and assume no recipes are enabled by default.

<ArgumentCon> Bad user experience as statically configured recipe won't work out of the box until enabled in core </ArgumentCon>

### Create a default tenant in core with all recipes enabled

<ArgumentPro> Better user experience with statically configured recipes, as they will work as expected </ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentPro> Recipes can do recipe checks for default tenant and other tenants alike </ArgumentPro>
