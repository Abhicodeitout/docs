# Keep adding withCredentials in header mode

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-10-25" created="2022-10-25" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

We could skip adding `withCredentials` in case of header based auth.

## Considered Options

* Skip
* Keep the default

## Decision Outcome

We are keeping the default, since we can't always reliably detect if a session exists (Safari after 7 days), so this is to make sure migration works.
