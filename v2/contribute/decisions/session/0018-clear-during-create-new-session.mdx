# Clear unused token transfer methods when creating new session

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-11-22" created="2022-11-22" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

We could end up in a situation where the user is trying to create a new session while there is one already active. If they are using the same auth mode the old session would be overwritten, but if they are different we could end up with two active sessions stored in two different ways on the frontend.

## Considered Options

* Not clearing
* Clearing

## Decision Outcome

Clear unused token transfer methods when creating new session. Reasons:
- We want to avoid tokens (especially tokens of different sessions) being present in both cookies and headers
- Refresh already clears sessions
