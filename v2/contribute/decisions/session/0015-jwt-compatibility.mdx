# Deprecate JWT option once the access token is a proper JWT itself

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to make our access token into a valid JWT. So, in the future the jwt setting will be "replaced" with just setting the auth mode to header. We need to decide a deprecation/migration path.

## Considered Options

* Add deprecation warning if the jwt setting is turned on.
* Keep the jwt option.

## Decision Outcome

Once we make the entire access token into a JWT:
- Add deprecation warning with a migration link and set `exposeAccessTokenToFrontendInCookieBasedAuth` to true. See [here](./0022)
- Add a function to the FE to access the entire access token as a string.

Until then: the auth mode and jwt options are entirely independent, the jwt can be accessed through the access token payload in both auth modes.
