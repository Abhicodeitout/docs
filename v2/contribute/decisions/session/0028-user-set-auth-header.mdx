# Ignore Authorization header set by the user if it matches the access token

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-12-06" created="2022-12-06" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

If the user sets the access token as the authorization header (like what you have to do for some other SDKs), it can cause issues with automatic refreshing.

## Considered Options

* Disable automatic refresh/retry if authorization header is set
* Ignore authorization header if it matches the access token
* Throw error if the authorization header matches the access token

## Decision Outcome

We will ignore the authorization set by the user if it matches the access token, because:
- People expect the need to set the authorization header, so they might do so even if they shouldn't
- If they do this with something else in the authorization header, a 401 will still cause an infinite refresh loop. People can work around this by changing the status code of the UNAUTHORISED response.
- While the infinite refresh loop is a problem, it's very noticable and causes early (and easy to fix) failure.
- If we disable the automatic refresh feature, people may miss the reasoning for this and think that the feature is not working (even if we log a warning).
- We prefer silently making this work instead of throwing an error, because that would create friction during implementation.
