# After the access token becomes a full JWT, we can drop the backend-core handshake

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-11-28" created="2022-11-28" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

The backend-core handshake is mainly used to fetch a few config values and the list of valid signing public keys we can use to locally validate access tokens. The fetched config values are:
- Anti-csrf mode
- Access token blacklisting enabled
- Access token validity
- Refresh token validity

## Considered Options

* Keep the handshake
* Remove handshake

## Decision Outcome

We can drop the handshake:
- Anti-csrf mode can be defined on the backend
- Access token blacklisting will be moved to the backend
- Validities are already sent in the create and refresh core API responses
- The core JWKs endpoint can return the necessary public keys. 
- Since these JWTs (the access token) should still be signed in the Core, the validation should fetch the public keys from the Core as well, which should also conform to the standard.
- These public keys can be mirrored in the jwks endpoint exposed by the backend SDK if necessary (e.g.: other services/FE want to validate the JWT signature), but this can be disabled.

Reasons:
- This will enable us to use a standard JWT validation library to validate the access tokens
- This should improve start-up times, which can be important in serverless environments
