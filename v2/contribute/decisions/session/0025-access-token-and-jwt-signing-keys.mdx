# We should use the same keys to sign access tokens and custom JWTs

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-12-06" created="2022-12-06" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

Since our access tokens will be standard JWTs and we want to enable their verification without our SDK, we will expose the public keys using a jwks endpoint. These can be the same as the keys we use to sign other (custom) JWTs.

## Considered Options

* Separate keysets exposed under separate endpoint
* Separate keysets exposed under a single endpoint
* Same keyset

## Decision Outcome

We should use the same keyset to sign access tokens and custom JWTs:
- Having separate endpoints could be confusing to users
- Having separate settings for the two keysets could be confusing if we expose them under the same endpoint
- Exposing the union of the two keysets under the same endpoint could cause (minor) problems when caching keys for verification
- Check [this decision](./0029) for discussion on static and dynamic keys.
