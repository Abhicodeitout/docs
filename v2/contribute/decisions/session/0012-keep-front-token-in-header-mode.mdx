# Keep front-token in header mode auth

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-10-25" created="2022-10-25" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

The front-token can be removed in the case of a header based auth, since the information can be parsed from the access token as well

## Considered Options

* Leave as is
* Remove

## Decision Outcome

Keep, because this way we don't have to handle parsing on the FE and people can just ignore it safely if they prefer.
