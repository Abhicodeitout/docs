# Access token claims should be renamed to match JWT standards

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-12-06" created="2022-12-06" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to make our access tokens into a standard JWT. This means we will need to add some new claims, but some of them are already present with non-standard names.

## Considered Options

* Duplicate claims
* Rename claims

## Decision Outcome

We should rename claims to match the standard
- We need to match the standard to enable our users to use a jwt verification library on backends without our SDKs.
- We should not duplicate claims (if avoidable at all), because that would inflate the access token.
