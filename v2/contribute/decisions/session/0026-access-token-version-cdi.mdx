# Issue non-JWT access tokens for requests with old CDI versions

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-12-06" created="2022-12-06" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

Since our access token structure will change drastically, the backend SDKs will need to be updated to match.

## Considered Options

* Drop support for older CDIs.
* Issue old access tokens for requests with older CDIs

## Decision Outcome

We should issue old access tokens for requests with older CDIs:
- Requiring a simultanious upgrade of multiple components (core + BE SDK in this case) should be avoided if possible.
- Backend SDKs can support both versions, but this can provide an easier upgrade path.
