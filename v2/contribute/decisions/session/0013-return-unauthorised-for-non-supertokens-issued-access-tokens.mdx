# Return UNATHORISED for non-supertokens issued access tokens

## Context and Problem Statement

People could try and call an API protected by verifySession with an access token from another provider (e.g.: during migration)

## Considered Options

* Keep try refresh token
* Return UNAUTHORISED without clearing cookies

## Decision Outcome

Throw UNAUTHORISED (without clearing cookies) and undefined in case of optional session verification if the access token in the request was not issued by SuperTokens.
Otherwise, we can return try refresh token.
