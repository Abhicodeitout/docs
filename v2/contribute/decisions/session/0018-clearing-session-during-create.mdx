# Delete tokens of unused token transfer methods during createNewSession

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-11-24" created="2022-11-24" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

In some cases, createNewSession can be called while there is an active session. Normally this would overwrite the old session, but there could be tokens present in other token transfer methods. E.g.:
- The request has an access token attached as header
- createNewSession is called
- getTokenTransferMethod returns cookies (for example because of a user override)
- We would are overwriting cookies, but that leaves tokens in storage associated with headers

## Considered Options

* Do not clear
* Clear other token transfer methods - if they have attached anything to the request (even invalid or expired tokens)

## Decision Outcome

Clear other token transfer methods. Reasons:
- We only want the tokens of a single session present in the browser.
- It avoids future issues/confusion by proactively cleaning up and not depending on future refresh calls.
- We will only clear headers/cookies if they were sent to us, avoiding sending the FE unexpected headers.
