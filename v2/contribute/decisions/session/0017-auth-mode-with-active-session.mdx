# Auth-mode should be set to the configured preference

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-11-22" created="2022-11-22" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

- As per [this decision](./0008) active sessions can't change auth-methods even through refreshing.
- As per [this decision](./0007) the backend ignores the contents of the auth-mode header in `verifySession`

Now we need to decide what to do if the preference set in the frontend config doesn't match the active session.

## Considered Options

* Skip attaching the auth-mode to requests
* Always send the auth-mode preference set in the config
* Auth-mode should be set to the mode of the active session if present and the configured value otherwise

## Decision Outcome

Always send the auth-mode preference set in the config. Reasons:
- We only use the auth-mode header to decide the token transfer method of new sessions
- It signifies the preference of the frontend - doesn't mean that the backend will respect it
- Since both `getSession` and `refreshSession` ignores it, it's safe to attach to every request
- We should attach it to every request, because then this information will get to `createNewSession` in every case
