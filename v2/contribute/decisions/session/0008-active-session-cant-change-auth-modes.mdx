# Active session can't change auth-modes

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide if we can upgrade in get/verifySession on refresh calls

## Considered Options

* All
* Refresh only
* None (change in settings only take effect when creating new session)

## Decision Outcome

Active session can't change auth-modes. Reasons:
- Allowing it in all request would increase implementation complexity for not much gain and it'd make our vulnerability of XSS attacks worse.
- If we allow changing the auth-mode during session refresh we increase the attack surface of XSS.
- An XSS attack could still steal tokens by changing the auth-method during sign-in, but in this case they could also capture the user credentials.
- This means that changing the default auth-mode in the frontend SDK will only have effect after the user logs in again.

As a consequence:
- Refresh session will not change the auth-mode of incoming requests.
- In case both cookies and headers are there, we default to headers (see [here](./0003))
- Respecting the auth-mode header in case both exist during a refresh call would provide no real advantage:
    - this should not happen while using a FE SDK:
        - when refreshing or creating sessions we clear the token transfer methods we are not using (e.g.: we clear cookies when creating a session using headers).
        - there can be some edge cases (changing versions back-and-forth during development): we are not optimising for this
    - the most likely case is someone sending manual requests:
        - Headers should take priority as that's more likely to be intentional.
    - it could be an attacker through XSS:
        - even if we reject this/use cookies, they could call logout to clear old cookies before adding their own tokens, completely replacing the session
- In case both cookies and headers are there, refresh will clear the one we are not using.

### Expected behaviour of refreshSession as a table

| Authorization header 	| Refresh token cookie 	| Output                    	            | Set tokens in  | Cleared tokens        |
|----------------------	|---------------------	|-----------------------------------------	|--------------  |-------------------	 |
| none                 	| none               	| UNAUTHORISED              	            | -              | none                  |
| none                 	| exists               	| Validate refresh token from cookie        | cookies        | none                  |
| exists               	| none                 	| Validate refresh token from header        | headers        | none                  |
| exists               	| exists               	| Validate refresh token from header        | headers        | cookies               |
