# Remove id refresh token

## Context and Problem Statement

We can remove the id-refresh-token, since we never really use the value and only check it as a clue for the existence of a refresh token.

## Considered Options

* Leave as is
* Remove

## Decision Outcome

We've chosen to remove the id refresh token, since we don't need it and we can solve it entirely in the FE
- We have to change the expiration of the access token cookie (just the cookie) to 100 years.
