# Provide support for header based auth

## Context and Problem Statement

There are a few circumstances where apps would want to use headers to authenticate or access the token on the client side.

## Considered Options

* Integrated implementation
* Guide

## Decision Outcome

We provide our own implementation since this seems to be a fairly common use-case and implementing this outside the SDK can get complicated.
