# Add new JWKs endpoint on the standard path

<DecisionHeader status="proposed" lastUpdate="2022-12-06" created="2022-12-06" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "porcellus"]} proposedBy={["porcellus"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

We already have a jwks endpoint available in the Core, but it's exposed under a non-standard path and non standard format + it requires the core API key.

## Considered Options

* Leave as-is
* Move endpoint in a new CDI version
* Duplicate it in the standard path not taking CDI version into account
* Add new endpoint on the standard path

## Decision Outcome

We should move the JWKs endpoint in a new CDI version to a standard path:
- This will make it easier for people to use us with standard JWT verification libs on the backend
- It should not check the api key or send the extra "status" prop
- Conforming to standards is always a plus
