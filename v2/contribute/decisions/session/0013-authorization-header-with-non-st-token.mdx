# Treat Authorization header as empty if it doesn't contain a SuperTokens token

## Context and Problem Statement

People could try and call an API protected by verifySession with an access token from another provider (e.g.: during migration)

## Considered Options

* Keep try refresh token
* Return UNAUTHORISED without clearing cookies
* Handle it as if it was not sent

## Decision Outcome

Handle it as if it was not sent, because:
- Devs could try to attach an Authorization header meant for a different middleware - we can just use our own cookies if they exist
- This is the way we handled things before adding header based auth - this way it can keep working the same for people who don't opt into using headers

This means:
- We fall back to cookies if we detect the Authorization header contains anything that is not our accesstoken
- If cookies don't exist we return TRY_REFRESH_TOKEN
- If cookies exist we go through the usual validation steps
