# Need for canLinkAccounts and canCreatePrimaryUserId

<DecisionHeader status="accepted" lastUpdate="2022-11-29" created="2022-11-29" deciders={["rishabhpoddar", "bhumilsarvaiya"]} proposedBy={["bhumilsarvaiya"]} />

## Context and Problem Statement

Do we really need canLinkAccounts and canCreatePrimaryUser functions? On a recipe level and on a index.ts level (exposed to the user)?

## Considered Options

* Not expose either of the functions
* Expose both the functions but make them not overridable
* Expose both the functions and make them overridable


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Expose both the functions and make them overridable, because

* User may want to use these functions while performing some custom logic
* By design, we allow users to override the functions exposed by recipe interface. We don't want to change that so these functions will be overridable

Additional details, etc.


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Not expose either of the functions

<ArgumentCon>What if the user wants to use these functions in their custom logic somewhere</ArgumentCon>

### Expose both the functions but make them not overridable

<ArgumentCon> By design, we allow users to override the functions exposed by recipe interface. We don't want to change that so these functions will be overridable</ArgumentCon>

### Expose both the functions and make them overridable

<ArgumentPro>User may want to use these functions while performing some custom logic</ArgumentPro>
<ArgumentPro>By design, we allow users to override the functions exposed by recipe interface. We don't want to change that so these functions will be overridable</ArgumentPro>
