# New built in claim expressing intent to link an account

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to verify email B even if logged in using email A, cause post login account linking may require you to verify email B in order to link it. For this to happen, we need a way for email verification related UI and APIs to know about email B

## Considered Options

* Update accessToken payload email verification claim to have additional information regarding email B (email for which email verification needs to be done)
* Add a new session claim that marks the session as "intent to link an account"
* The frontend will send the recipeUserId to the backend during email verification APIs. So instead of the backend taking a session as input, they will take a recipeUserId + session as an input.

## Decision Outcome

Option chosen: Add a new session claim that marks the session as "intent to link an account"

This claim will be added during:
- Post login account linking API in case email verification is required for the to link account.
- In sign up related APIs like createCodePOST for passwordless if this is called with an input session.

New payload structure:
```ts
{
   "st-acc-to-link":{
      v: <recipe user ID> | "",
      t: ....,
   }
}
```
* The v will be `""` if this claim is being added in APIs like createCodePOST and the user does not exist. Else it will be the recipeUserId of the new user.
* The email verification UI on the frontend and related APIs (create and consume verification code + is email verified API), check if this claim is present if the `EmailVerificationClaim` value is `true`. If this claim exists, and has a user ID, then it will use that for its operations.
* This implies that the user will still be able to use their app routes and app's APIs even if the new account to link is kept in unverified mode.
* This claim is removed when the account to link is either no longer a candidate for linking to the current session's account, or has already been linked.

This claim should also be used by passwordless login screen (like OTP or enter email / phone screen) so that they do not redirect to the `/` route in case a session exists, and this claim exists as well.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Update accessToken payload email verification claim to have additional information regarding email B (email for which email verification needs to be done)

<ArgumentCon> This requires changing the base claim structure. </ArgumentCon>

### Add a new session claim that marks the session as "intent to link an account"

<ArgumentPro> Is more generic and can be used for purposes other than for email verification </ArgumentPro>

### The frontend will send the recipeUserId to the backend during email verification APIs. So instead of the backend taking a session as input, they will take a recipeUserId + session as an input.

<ArgumentCon> Intre=oduces complexity for users who are building their custom UI - they would have to manually pass the correct user ID. </ArgumentCon>
