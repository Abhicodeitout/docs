# Core

This is a http microservice written in Java and is responsible for interfacing with the db and providing a set of APIs (CDI spec) that the backend SDK can use. The primary purpose of this SDK is to:
- Reading / writing to the db
- A lot of the "core" logic
    - For example, how the session tokens are created
    - The db query logic to make sure that there are no duplicate userIds being created
    - Cronjobs to remove sessions that have expired.
    - Storing and verifying password hashes (and salt).
- Provide an in memory db (using SQLite) that implements the plugin interface - so that users can quickly get started without actually connecting it to a db. This also helps with testing.

For the various operations need to interface with the db, and that is done via an interface called the plugin interface.
