# Backend SDK

The user integrates this with their backend API layer. They can also integrate it with their web server for certain use cases. The primary function of these SDKs is to
- Expose APIs as per the FDI spec
- Provide a way for the user to query the core
- Wrap all the core APIs with functions that the user can call in their own APIs
- Allow the user to modify the FDI APIs and the recipe logic as per their needs.

For the various operations provided by the SDK, we must query a set of APIs expose by the core. These APIs are specificed in the core driver interface (CDI).
