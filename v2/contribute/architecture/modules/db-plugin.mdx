# Database plugin

These are java "plugins" / JARs that implement the plugin interface to interact with a specific db. For example, the mysql plugin will implement the plugin interface to read / write info to a mysql instance. The primary purpose of these are to:
- Maintain a connection pool to the underlying db
- Implement the plugin interface and map them to queries for the db being implemented for.
- Provide a way for transactions to take place (if applicable).

These plugins are [dynamically loaded by the core at runtime](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/blob/master/src/main/java/io/supertokens/storageLayer/StorageLayer.java#L44), if the user has specified connection info that tallies with this plugin.
