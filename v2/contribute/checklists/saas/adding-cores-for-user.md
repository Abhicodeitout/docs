# Adding cores for user's existing account
- With any one account, create a Saas app. Also do production deployment if required.
- Now, get the userId `U1` for whom we need to add a new core.
- Let `A1` be the appId that got created in the first step
- In `apps` table, change the userId for app `A1` to `U1`.
