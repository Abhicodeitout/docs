# How it works

You need to start by choosing your first factor auth. This can be any of the [auth recipes](https://supertokens.com/docs/guides) we support. A common choice is the [thirdpartyemailpassword recipe](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/introduction) which allows users to sign in with social or email / password login.

For the second factor, whilst you can choose any of our auth recipes as well, the most common choice is the [Passwordless recipe](https://supertokens.com/docs/passwordless/introduction), using which, you can send SMS or email OTP (or magic links) to the user.

You will also need to use our Session recipe which can be used to store information about which factors have been completed by the user for the current session. This will be integral to our implementation.

As a high level flow, we will customise these recipes in the following way:
- After the first factor is completed, we will override the `createNewSession` function in the Session recipe to store the fact that only the first factor is complete. This can be done in many ways (since it's just a JSON payload). In the example app, we store a `phoneNumberVerified` boolean which is `false` after first factor completion, and `true` after the second factor is completed.
- After the second factor is completed, we will update the access token's payload to set `phoneNumberVerified` to `true`.
- In the APIs and frontend routes, we will verify the session, and grant access to the APIs only if `phoneNumberVerified` is `true` (in the access token payload). Therefore, the APIs and frontend routes are protected and require the user to have completed both the auth challenges. You can also relax this constraint for some APIs to only require a session, and this way, the user can access those even if they have not completed the second factor challenge.
- We also need to use the `UserMetadata` recipe to store information about the second factor auth's identification. In the example app, we use phone number SMS OTP as the second factor, so we store the user's phone number using the `UserMetadata` recipe, and only send OTPs to that number during sign in. The phone number itself is obtained during the sign up flow.

The reason we store the MFA completion info in the session is because:
- The login action makes sense per session. If the user logs out and tries to login again, they need to go through both the factors again.
- The frontend and backend routes can access it without doing extra I/O operations.

In the subsequent sections, we will see how to implement 2fa with the first factor being social and email / password login, and the second factor being phone SMS OTP.

If you require a different set of factors or behaviour, you can take inspiration from this guide.
