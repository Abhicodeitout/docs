# How it works

You need to start by choosing your first factor auth. This can be any of the [auth recipes](https://supertokens.com/docs/guides) we support. A common choice is the [thirdpartyemailpassword recipe](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/introduction) which allows users to sign in with social or email / password login.

For the second factor, whilst you can choose any of our auth recipes as well, the most common choice is the [Passwordless recipe](https://supertokens.com/docs/passwordless/introduction), using which, you can send SMS or email OTP (or magic links) to the user.

You will also need to use our Session recipe which can be used to store information about which factors have been completed by the user for the current session. This will be integral to our implementation.

As a high level flow, we will customise these recipes in the following way:
- After the first factor is completed, we will override the `createNewSession` function in the Session recipe to store the fact that only the first factor is complete. We do this by adding the `SecondFactorClaim` to the session which will default to false.
- After the second factor is completed, we will update the session and set `SecondFactorClaim` to true.
- To protect the APIs we will add a `SecondFactorClaim` validator to the global validators by overriding `getGlobalClaimValidators`. This will check if the second factor has been completed during the `verifySession`. This can be changed for specific routes by passing `overrideGlobalClaimValidators` in the options of `verifySession`.
- To protect frontend routes, we will a wrap protected routes with a `SessionAuth` component and add a `SecondFactorClaim` validator to the global validators by overriding `getGlobalClaimValidators`. This will add a validation error into the `invalidClaims` array of the session context of the wrapped components in case the validator failed.
- We also need to use the `UserMetadata` recipe to store information about the second factor auth's identification. In the example app, we use phone number SMS OTP as the second factor, so we store the user's phone number using the `UserMetadata` recipe, and only send OTPs to that number during sign in. The phone number itself is obtained during the sign up flow.

The reason we store the MFA completion info in the session is because:
- The login action makes sense per session. If the user logs out and tries to login again, they need to go through both the factors again.
- The frontend and backend routes can access it without doing extra I/O operations.

In the subsequent sections, we will see how to implement 2fa with the first factor being social and email / password login, and the second factor being phone SMS OTP.

If you require a different set of factors or behaviour, you can take inspiration from this guide.
