## First factor UI

If you have correctly followed the frontend setup guide in the [ThirdPartyEmailPassword recipe](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/quick-setup/frontend), you should see the login UI when you visit `^{form_websiteDomain}^{form_websiteBasePath}?rid=thirdpartyemailpassword`. 

No further step is required for the first factor.

## Second factor UI

For this guide, we will be showing the second factor UI on `/second-factor` (you can change this to whichever path you like).

### 1) Disable the default UI
```tsx
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";

Passwordless.init({
    contactMethod: "PHONE",
    // highlight-start
    signInUpFeature: {
        // this will prevent the passwordless UI from being rendered when you 
        // visit ^{form_websiteDomain}^{form_websiteBasePath}?rid=passwordless
        disableDefaultUI: true,
    },
    // highlight-end
})
```

### 2) Show the Passwordless UI on `/second-factor`

Create a React component for `/second-factor` screen in which, you can render the Passwordless UI as follows:
```tsx
import React from "react"
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";

export default function SecondFactor() {
    return (
        <div
            style={{
                display: "flex",
                flexDirection: "column",
                alignItems: "center",
                justifyContent: "center",
            }}>
            // highlight-next-line
            <Passwordless.SignInUp />
            <div
                onClick={async () => {
                    // TODO:
                }}
                style={{
                    cursor: "pointer",
                    color: "blue",
                    textDecoration: "underline",
                }}>
                Login with another account
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

:::note
Notice that we have also rendered a `"Login with another account"` button below the UI. This will help users to start the login flow again if they wish to. We will circle back to the implementation of the `onClick` handler for this.

Now if you navigate to `/second-factor`, you should see the enter phone number UI box. In the next sections, we will be seeing how to fix the routing so that this screen is only accessible if the user has finished the first factor.
