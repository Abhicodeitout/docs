# 5) Automatically sending OTP on sign in

<Disclaimer />

The final piece of the puzzle is to modify the Passwordless UI to:
- Send the OTP automatically to the user's phone number after sign in. However during sign up, we want the user to enter their phone number (which is what happens by default anyway).
- Remove the change phone number button on the OTP screen if the phone number is in their session.
- Change the "Sign Up or Log In" header to say "Second factor auth". 

All of these can be achieved by using [React component override feature](https://supertokens.com/docs/passwordless/advanced-customizations/react-component-override/about) in the `Passwordless.init` call.

## Sending the OTP automatically

We start by overriding the React component that asks the user to input their phone number (called `PasswordlessPhoneForm_Override`). In our custom override component, we use the `useEffect` hook to check if a phone number already exists in the session (implying that this is a sign in), and if it does, we send it an OTP. 

We can send it an OTP using the `createCode` recipe function. On success, it will change the UI to the enter OTP form. While the `createCode` funciton is making a network call, we show an empty screen to the user. This is not a problem since network calls like these are very quick anyway.

```tsx
import React, {useEffect, useState} from "react"
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword";

Passwordless.init({
    signInUpFeature: {
        disableDefaultUI: true,
    },
    getRedirectionURL: async function (context) {
        if (context.action === "SIGN_IN_AND_UP") {
            return "/second-factor";
        }
    },
    contactMethod: "PHONE",
    override: {
        components: {
            // highlight-start
            // we override the component which asks the user for their phone number
            PasswordlessPhoneForm_Override: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                // state used to decide if we should show the default UI or not.
                let [showDefaultUI, setShowDefaultUI] = useState(false);

                useEffect(() => {
                    Session.getAccessTokenPayloadSecurely()
                        .then(async (accessTokenPayload) => {
                            // we see if the access token has the phoneNumber in it
                            let phoneNumber = accessTokenPayload.phoneNumber;
                            if (phoneNumber !== undefined) {
                                // This will send the user an OTP and also change the UI to the "enter OTP screen".
                                await props.recipeImplementation.createCode({
                                    phoneNumber: phoneNumber,
                                    userContext: {},
                                });
                            } else {
                                // phone number does not exist in the session, so we 
                                // ask the user for their phone number.
                                setShowDefaultUI(true);
                            }
                        })
                        .catch((err) => {
                            // it can come here if a session doesn't exist.
                            // in this case, the screen should redirect to the
                            // first login challenge
                            ThirdPartyEmailPassword.redirectToAuth({
                                redirectBack: false,
                            });
                        });
                }, [props.recipeImplementation]);

                if (showDefaultUI) {
                    // returning this will render the UI which asks the user
                    // for their phone number. This is true if the session doesn't already have a phone
                    // number in it implying that the user never setup their second factor.
                    return <DefaultComponent {...props} />;
                }

                // we show an empty screen whilst we are in a loading state for this
                return null;
            },
            // highlight-end
        },
    },
})
```

## Removing the "change phone number button" based on if the session has a phone number.

By default, there is a button on the enter OTP screen which allows the user to change their phone number entered in the previous screen. In the case that the phone number exists in the session, we do not want to show this button since we do not allow the user to enter a phone number in the first place.

```tsx
import React, {useEffect, useState} from "react"
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword";

Passwordless.init({
    signInUpFeature: {
        disableDefaultUI: true,
    },
    getRedirectionURL: async function (context) {
        if (context.action === "SIGN_IN_AND_UP") {
            return "/second-factor";
        }
    },
    contactMethod: "PHONE",
    override: {
        components: {
            // highlight-start
            // we override the component which shows the change phone number button
            PasswordlessUserInputCodeFormFooter_Override: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                // the logic here is very similar to the previous step's logic
                let [showDefaultUI, setShowDefaultUI] = useState(false);
                useEffect(() => {
                    Session.getAccessTokenPayloadSecurely()
                        .then(async (accessTokenPayload) => {
                            let phoneNumber = accessTokenPayload.phoneNumber;
                            if (phoneNumber === undefined) {
                                // since the phone number does not exist in the access token's
                                // payload, we want to show the button
                                setShowDefaultUI(true);
                            }
                        })
                        .catch((err) => {
                            // it can come here if a session doesn't exist.
                            // in this case, the screen we should redirect to the
                            // first login challenge
                            ThirdPartyEmailPassword.redirectToAuth({
                                redirectBack: false,
                            });
                        });
                }, [props.recipeImplementation]);
                if (showDefaultUI) {
                    // this will show the change phone number button
                    return <DefaultComponent {...props} />;
                }

                // this will hide the change phone number button
                return null;
            },
            // highlight-end
            // @ts-ignore
            PasswordlessPhoneForm_Override: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                /* ...From previous step */
            },
        },
    },
})
