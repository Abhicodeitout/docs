# 5) Automatically sending OTP on sign in

<Disclaimer />

The final piece of the puzzle is to modify the Passwordless UI to:
- Send the OTP automatically to the user's phone number after sign in. However during sign up, we want the user to enter their phone number (which is what happens by default anyway).
- Remove the change phone number button on the OTP screen if the phone number is in their session.
- Change the "Sign Up or Log In" header to say "Second factor auth". 

All of these can be achieved by using [React component override feature](https://supertokens.com/docs/passwordless/advanced-customizations/react-component-override/about) in the `Passwordless.init` call and by customizing the `<SignInUpTheme>` component in the `/second-factor` route.

## Sending the OTP automatically

We start by customizing the sign in/up component of the Passwordless recipe. In our custom component, we use the `useEffect` hook to check if a phone number already exists in the session (implying that this is a sign in), and if it does, we send it an OTP. 
We also set `successInAnotherTab` to false, since the original component would show a success screen if it detects that the user has an active session.

We can send an OTP using the `createCode` recipe function. On success, it will change the UI to the enter OTP form. While the `createCode` funciton is making a network call, we show an empty screen to the user. This is not a problem since network calls like these are very quick anyway.

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { redirectToAuth } from "supertokens-auth-react";
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";
import Session, { useSessionContext } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";

const CustomSignInUpTheme: typeof Passwordless.SignInUpTheme = (props) => {
    let [showDefaultUI, setShowDefaultUI] = useState(false);
    const session = useSessionContext();

    useEffect(() => {
        let aborting = false;
        async function effect() {
            if (session.loading === true) {
                return;
            }

            const phoneNumber = session.accessTokenPayload.phoneNumber;
            // If don't have a phone number we show the default UI (which should be the phone form)
            if (phoneNumber === undefined) {
                setShowDefaultUI(true);
            } else {
                // we start the OTP flow if it's not started already
                if (props.featureState.loginAttemptInfo === undefined) {
                    await props.recipeImplementation.createCode({ phoneNumber, userContext: props.userContext });
                }

                if (aborting) {
                    return;
                }
                // since we calling the createCode function above, showing the default UI now will
                // show the enter OTP form.
                setShowDefaultUI(true);
            }
        }
        effect();
        return () => {
            aborting = true;
        };
    }, []);

    // If this was active, we'd not show the OTP screen because it'd detect an active session.
    props.featureState.successInAnotherTab = false;

    if (showDefaultUI) {
        return <Passwordless.SignInUpTheme {...props} />;
    }
    return <></>;
};
```

## Removing the "change phone number button" based on if the session has a phone number.

By default, there is a button on the enter OTP screen which allows the user to change their phone number entered in the previous screen. In the case that the phone number exists in the session, we do not want to show this button since we do not allow the user to enter a phone number in the first place.

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react"
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";
import Session, { useSessionContext } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword";

Passwordless.init({
    signInUpFeature: {
        disableDefaultUI: true,
    },
    contactMethod: "PHONE",
    override: {
        components: {
            // highlight-start
            // we override the component which shows the change phone number button
            PasswordlessUserInputCodeFormFooter_Override: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                const session = useSessionContext();

                if (session.loading !== true && session.accessTokenPayload.phoneNumber === undefined) {
                    // this will show the change phone number button
                    return <DefaultComponent {...props} />;
                }

                // this will hide the change phone number button
                return null;
            },
            // highlight-end
        },
    },
})
```

## Change the "Sign Up or Log In" header to say "Second factor auth"

We can do this by overriding the header component for the Passwordless login UI. We will show "Second factor auth" as the title if the user is being shown the form to enter their phone number, else we will not render anything

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react"
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword";

Passwordless.init({
    signInUpFeature: {
        disableDefaultUI: true,
    },
    contactMethod: "PHONE",
    override: {
        components: {
            // @ts-ignore
            PasswordlessUserInputCodeFormFooter_Override: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                /* ...From previous step */
            },
            // highlight-start
            PasswordlessSignInUpHeader_Override: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                return (<div
                        style={{
                            fontSize: "30px",
                            marginBottom: "10px",
                        }}>
                        Second factor auth
                    </div>
                );
            },
            // highlight-end
        },
    },
})
```
