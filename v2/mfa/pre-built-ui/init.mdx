# Recipe init

- The pre built UI is not yet optimised for 2FA. We are working on providing dedicated screens for second factor, but until then, you will have to customise the first factor `Passwordless` recipe screen to act as a second factor.
- A demo app that uses the pre built UI can be found on [our GitHub](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-thirdpartyemailpassword-2fa-passwordless). Navigate to the `src` folder to see the frontend code.
:::

To start, we want to initialise the [ThirdPartyEmailPassword](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/quick-setup/frontend) and the [Passwordless](https://supertokens.com/docs/passwordless/quick-setup/frontend) recipes as mentioned in their quick setup section:

<AppInfoForm
    askForAppName
    askForAPIDomain
    askForWebsiteDomain
>

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword, {Github, Google, Facebook, Apple} from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword";
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        appName: "^{form_appName}",
        apiDomain: "^{form_apiDomain}",
        websiteDomain: "^{form_websiteDomain}",
        apiBasePath: "^{form_apiBasePath}",
        websiteBasePath: "^{form_websiteBasePath}"
    },
    recipeList: [
        // first factor method
        ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init({
            emailVerificationFeature: {
                mode: "REQUIRED",
            },
            signInAndUpFeature: {
                providers: [
                    Github.init(),
                    Google.init(),
                    Facebook.init(),
                    Apple.init(),
                ]
            }
        }),
        // second factor method
        Passwordless.init({
            contactMethod: "PHONE"
        }),
        Session.init()
    ]
});
```

</AppInfoForm>

In the subsequent sections, we will be seeing how to modify theses `init` calls so that we can achieve the flow we want. On a high level, we will be:
- Overriding the `doesSessionExist` function from the Session recipe to work based on which login factor has been completed.
- Rendering the Passwordless login UI on a custom path.
- Auto skipping the screen which asks the user to input their phone number if we already have it - post sign in.
- Implementing a logout button on the second factor pre built UI screen.
