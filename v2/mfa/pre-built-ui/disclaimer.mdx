- The pre built UI is not yet optimised for 2FA. We are working on providing dedicated screens for second factor, but until then, you will have to customise the first factor `Passwordless` recipe screen to act as a second factor (as shown in this guide).
- A demo app that uses the pre built UI can be found on [our GitHub](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-thirdpartyemailpassword-2fa-passwordless). Navigate to the `src` folder to see the frontend code.
