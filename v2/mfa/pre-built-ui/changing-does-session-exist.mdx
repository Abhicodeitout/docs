# 3) Overriding doesSessionExist

<Disclaimer />

Now if you try and login using the first factor, you will be redirected to `/second-factor` screen. But immediately after that, you will be sent to the `/` screen (indicating a successful sign in). This is incorrect behaviour since we want to the user to stay on the second factor screen and keep the user there until:
- They finish the second factor login successfully
- Click on the "Login with another account" button (See next section)

In order to achieve this, we will be overriding the `doesSessionExist` recipe function from the `Session.init` config. Internally, the `<ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth>` wrapper and the `<Passwordless.SignInUp />` component both use the `doesSessionExist` function to determine if a redirection is required:
- `<ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth>` wrapper: If `doesSessionExist` returns `false`, it will redirect the user to the auth screen, else it will keep the user on the current screen.
- `<Passwordless.SignInUp />` component: If `doesSessionExist` returns `false`, it will keep the user on the current screen (since this is a login screen), else it will redirect the user to `"/"` by default (or call `getRedirectionURL` with the `"SUCCESS"` context). 

We want to change the behaviour of this so that:
- `<ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth>` wrapper: Redirects the user to the login screen if a session does not exist, or if they have not completed both the factors.
- `<Passwordless.SignInUp />` component: Keeps the user on this screen if a session exists and they have not yet completed the second factor login.

So we modify the `Session.init` call like this:
```tsx
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session"

Session.init({
    override: {
        functions: (originalImplementation) => {
            return {
                ...originalImplementation,
                doesSessionExist: async function (input) {
                    if (!(await originalImplementation.doesSessionExist(input))) {
                        // The user has not finished the first factor.
                        // So the second factor screen, nor the protected website routes
                        // should be given access. 
                        return false;
                    }
                    if (window.location.pathname.startsWith("/auth")) {
                        // In our example, this "if condition" is true for the first factor. Here we do not
                        // want to return false because a session exists at this point, which means
                        // that the user finished the first factor already.
                        return true;
                    }
                    let accessTokenPayload = await this.getAccessTokenPayloadSecurely(input);
                    if (accessTokenPayload.is2faComplete !== true) {
                        // If both the factors have not been completed, we return false.
                        // The execution will come here when showing the /second-factor screen
                        // or if the user tries to navigate to another route but has only completed
                        // the first factor.
                        return false;
                    }

                    // this means both the factors have been completed.
                    return true;
                },
            };
        },
    },
})
```

Now if you finish the first factor, when you are navigated to the `/second-factor`, the UI will not redirect you to `"/"`. In fact, if you try to manually visit a protected route, at this point, it should navigate you to `/second-factor`.

:::caution
If you are using the `<SuperTokensWrapper />` component to wrap your entire app, you need to pass it a `key` prop which changes if the location does `startsWith("/auth")`. This is because the wrapper needs to know if it should recalculate if a session exists (for child components to consume), and we have overriden the `doesSessionExist` function to read from the window's path.

An example for how this is done can be found [in our demo app](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-thirdpartyemailpassword-2fa-passwordless/src/App.tsx#L182). 
:::

There is just one issue with the above. If you have not completed the first factor yet, and try and visit `/second-factor`, it will keep you there. In this case, we want to redirect the user back to the first factor screen. We can do this by using the [user context feature](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/advanced-customizations/user-context).

The idea is that when we are rendering our `SecondFactor`, we want to check if a session exists (by calling `Session.doesSessionExist()`) and pass it a context that will inform our custom logic to not care about if 2fa is completed or not - we simple want to return the result of calling `await originalImplementation.doesSessionExist(input)`

So we modify the `SecondFactor` component as follows:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword"
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session"

export default function SecondFactor() {
    // highlight-start
    React.useEffect(() => {
        // we redirect the user back to the first factor screen in case
        // their first factor auth is not done
        async function doCheck() {
            if (
                !(await Session.doesSessionExist({
                    // We add this custom user context which will be available to us
                    // in our override of doesSessionExist
                    userContext: {
                        forceOriginalCheck: true,
                    },
                }))
            ) {
                // It will come in this if block if a session does not exist (without checking for 2fa).
                // So we should redirect the user to the first auth screen.
                ThirdPartyEmailPassword.redirectToAuth({
                    redirectBack: false,
                });
            }
        }
        doCheck();
    }, []);
    // highlight-end
    return (
        <div>
            ...
        </div>
    );
}
```

And finally, we modify our `doesSessionExist` override to be like:
```tsx
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session"

Session.init({
    override: {
        functions: (originalImplementation) => {
            return {
                ...originalImplementation,
                doesSessionExist: async function (input) {
                    if (!(await originalImplementation.doesSessionExist(input))) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    // highlight-start
                    if (
                        window.location.pathname.startsWith("/auth") ||
                        input.userContext.forceOriginalCheck === true
                    ) {
                    // highlight-end
                        // The custom userContext from the SecondFactor component is set if
                        // when calling the doesSessionExist function from there. In this case,
                        // we want to return true here since 
                        // originalImplementation.doesSessionExist(input) returned true
                        return true;
                    }
                    let accessTokenPayload = await this.getAccessTokenPayloadSecurely(input);
                    if (accessTokenPayload.is2faComplete !== true) {
                        return false;
                    }

                    return true;
                },
            };
        },
    },
})
```

:::success
We have now completed the routing logic to include the 2FA state.
