# 3) Protecting routes

<Disclaimer />

Now we can use `SecondFactorClaim` to check if a user has completed both factors.

So we modify the `Session.init` call like this:
```tsx
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session"
import { BooleanClaim } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session"; // typecheck-only, removed from output
declare const SecondFactorClaim: BooleanClaim; // typecheck-only, removed from output

Session.init({
    override: {
        functions: (originalImplementation) => {
            return {
                ...originalImplementation,
                getGlobalClaimValidators: ({ claimValidatorsAddedByOtherRecipes }) => {
                    return [...claimValidatorsAddedByOtherRecipes, SecondFactorClaim.validators.isTrue()];
                },
            };
        },
    },
})
```

Now any component wrapped by a `<SessionAuth />` component will have a validation error in the `invalidClaims` array of session context if the user hasn't completed both factors. You can use this directly in your routes (to display a warning for example) or use a wrapper similar to this:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { SessionAuth, useSessionContext } from 'supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session';
import { UserRoleClaim, /*PermissionClaim*/ } from 'supertokens-auth-react/recipe/userroles';

const ProtectedRoute = (props: React.PropsWithChildren<any>) => {
    return (
        <SessionAuth>
            <InvalidClaimHandler>
                {props.children}
            </InvalidClaimHandler>
        </SessionAuth>
    );
}

function InvalidClaimHandler(props: React.PropsWithChildren<any>) {
    let sessionContext = useSessionContext();
    if (sessionContext.loading) {
        return null;
    }

    if (sessionContext.invalidClaims.some(i => i.validatorId === UserRoleClaim.id)) {
        // TODO: navigate to /second-factor
        return <div>You cannot access this page because you have not completed both factors.</div>
    }

    // We show the protected route since all claims validators have
    // passed implying that the user is an admin.
    return <div>{props.children}</div>;
}
```
Above we are creating a generic component called `ProtectedRoute` which enforces that its child components can only be rendered if the user has completed both factors.

In the `ProtectedRoute` component, we use the `SessionAuth` wrapper to ensure that the session exists. We've also added a `SecondFactorClaim` validator to the list of global validators , which the `<SessionAuth>` component will check by default.

Finally, we check the result of the validation in the `InvalidClaimHandler` component which displays `"You cannot access this page because you have not completed both factors."` if the `SecondFactorClaim` claim failed. In this case, you can also navigate the user to the `/second-factor` route.

If all validation passes, we render the `props.children` component.

We have now completed the routing logic to include the 2FA state.
