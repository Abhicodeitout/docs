# 4) Implementing the "Login with another account" button

<Disclaimer />

In the previous steps, we had added a "Login with another account" button to the second factor screen. This button would reset the state and ask the user to login via the first factor once again.

When the user clicks this button, we want to:
- Clear the current passwordless state of the browser (the recipe sets a state in localstorage after sending the OTP to prevent multiple OTPs being sent unnecessarily)
- Revoke the session.
- Redirect the user to the first factor.

This can be done fairly easly:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react"
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session"

export default function SecondFactor() {
    React.useEffect(() => {
        //... from previous step
    }, [])
    return (
        <div
            style={{
                display: "flex",
                flexDirection: "column",
                alignItems: "center",
                justifyContent: "center",
            }}>
            <Passwordless.SignInUp redirectOnSessionExists={false}>
                {
                    // @ts-ignore We ignore the error about missing props, since they'll be set by the feature component
                    <CustomSignInUpTheme />
                }
            </Passwordless.SignInUp>
            <div
                onClick={async () => {
                    // highlight-start
                    // clear local passwordless state (if any)
                    await Passwordless.clearLoginAttemptInfo();

                    // revoke the session
                    await Session.signOut({
                        userContext: {
                            forceOriginalCheck: true,
                        },
                    });

                    // redirect the user to the first factor
                    SuperTokens.redirectToAuth({
                        redirectBack: false,
                    });
                    // highlight-end
                }}
                style={{
                    cursor: "pointer",
                    color: "blue",
                    textDecoration: "underline",
                }}>
                Login with another account
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```
