# Making Requests

SuperTokens uses cookies for session verification. This means that no authorisation token must be added to requests when calling the graphQL API.

## Using Apollo Client
`ApolloClient` uses `fetch` underneath and we add the SuperTokens interceptor to `fetch` automatically when you call `supertokens.init`. So no action needs to be taken here.

## Using `axios` or `fetch`

<NetworkInterceptors />
