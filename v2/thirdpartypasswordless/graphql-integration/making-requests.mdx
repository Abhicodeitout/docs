# Making Requests

By default, SuperTokens SDK (or the browser itself) handles adding the access token to all requests. No authorisation token must be added to requests when calling the graphQL API.

## Using Apollo Client
`ApolloClient` uses `fetch` underneath and we add the SuperTokens interceptor to `fetch` and `XHR` automatically when you call `supertokens.init`. So no action needs to be taken here.
