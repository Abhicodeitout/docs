# Architecture

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## SDKs & Core
There are three components to SuperTokens:
- **Frontend SDK**: Responsible for rendering the login UI widgets and managing session tokens automatically.
- **Backend SDK**: Provides APIs for sign-up, sign-in, signout, session refreshing.. which the frontend widgets talk to.
- **SuperTokens Core**: This is a Java HTTP service that contains the core logic for auth. It's responsible for interfacing with the database and is used by the SuperTokens backend SDK for operations that require the db.

## Diagram example
Below is an example of how the three components interact for sign in and sign out flow (with email and password):

<Tabs
defaultValue="ms"
values={[
{label: 'Managed service', value: 'ms'},
{label: 'Self hosted', value: 'ss'},
]}>
<TabItem value="ms">
<img src="/img/architecture/managed_service.png" />
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ss">
<img src="/img/architecture/self_hosted.png" />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
You do **NOT** need to know Java, nor do you have to be using Java to use SuperTokens in your application. Java is used for the SuperTokens core which is a http microservice that your backend talks to.
