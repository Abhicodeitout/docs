# Concepts and terminology

## Recipes
SuperTokens is organized into modules that handle a specific part of the overall authentication experience. These modules are called ***Recipes***. Some of the ***Recipes*** we offer are:
- [EmailPassword](/docs/emailpassword/introduction): Use this for providing authentication via email and password. It includes sign in, sign up, reset password and email verification flows.
- [ThirdParty](/docs/thirdparty/introduction): Use this for providing social login or auth via any generic [OIDC provider](https://openid.net/connect/). This also provides the email verification flow.
- [Session](/docs/session/introduction): Use this for session management post login. This recipe allows you to create, revoke and refresh sessions. As such, it also provides the logout functionality.

You can use multiple recipes within your application. For example, you can use the emailpassword recipe and the session recipe togther to provide a full auth experience in your app.

A recipe can also be used inside another recipe. For example, we have the [ThirdPartyEmailPassword recipe](/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/introduction) which uses the EmailPassword and ThirdParty recipes inside it.

This modularity also allows you to use our Session recipe just on its own. You would do this in case you have your own login method and want to use SuperTokeks just for session management.

## Managed service and self-hosted

:::important
First please see the [architecture section](/docs/community/architecture).
:::

If you choose the managed service option, we will run the [SuperTokens Core](/docs/community/architecture) for you in a region of our choice. We will also be running the database that is used by the core. In this mode, you will still need to run a backend API layer which integrates with our backend SDK.

For the self-hosted version, you will have to run the SuperTokens core service yourself. We allow you to do so via our docker image or by downloading a ZIP file and installing it. This core will have to be connected to your database.

## Overrides
This feature allows you to change the default functionality of SuperTokens on the frontend or on the backend. Using this, you can:
- Change our default UI
- Add pre / post API logic
- Entirely disable or arbitrarily modify our API logic

If you are familiar with Auth0 actions, or AWS Congito's lambda triggers, ***Overrides*** is our version of that. However, unlike those, you can use the override feature to make changes (to SuperTokens) within your own backend API code. 

There are specific types of overrides:
- Recipe function overrides (on the backend)
- API functions override (on the backend)
- Recipe function overrides (on the frontend)
- ReactJS component override (on the frontend)

To know more about these, please see the "Advanced customization" section for your recipe docs

## Frontend driver interface ([FDI](https://supertokens.io/docs/fdi))
:::important
First please see the [architecture section](/docs/community/architecture).
:::

This is the API spec that defines the APIs exposed by our backend SDK. Your frontend can use these APIs to drive the UI.

These APIs are exposed via your API layer on the `/auth` path by default. This path is known as the `apiBasePath`. For example, if your API domain is `https://api.myapp.com`, then the sign out API we expose can be reached by `https://api.myapp.com/auth/signout`.

See the [API spec here](https://supertokens.io/docs/fdi).

## Core driver interface ([CDI](https://supertokens.io/docs/cdi))
:::important
First please see the [architecture section](/docs/community/architecture).
:::

This is the API spec that defines the APIs exposed by the SuperTokens core.

These APIs are to be called only by your backend API layer and **never** directly from the frontend (see FDI for APIs to call on the frontend). Think of these APIs for admin use to control SuperTokens and all of its user data.

You can call these APIs directly from your backend, or use the functions our SDK exposes to call them. We recommend using our SDK functions since those have auto-retry logic when querying the core, and they are easier to use.

See the [API spec here](https://supertokens.io/docs/cdi).
