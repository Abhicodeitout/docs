# Backend Setup

:::important
This guide uses `express`, if you are using another backend framework you can use this guide as a reference for the various steps involved in integrating with SuperTokens but some parts may need tweaking depending on the framework you are using.
:::

## a) Complete the setup guides

<PreBuiltOrCustomUISwitcher>

<PreBuiltUIContent>

Follow the [frontend and backend pre-built UI setup guides](../pre-built-ui/setup/frontend) to setup SuperTokens.

</PreBuiltUIContent>

<CustomUIContent>

Follow the [frontend and backend custom UI setup guides](../custom-ui/init/frontend) to setup SuperTokens.

</CustomUIContent>

</PreBuiltOrCustomUISwitcher>

## b) Install GraphQL dependencies on your backend

:::info
We use Apollo server in this example, SuperTokens can be used with other GraphQL libraries as well.
:::

```bash
npm install @apollo/server graphql
```

## c) Setup GraphQL

### Create your schema 

In this example we will create a simple social app that allows logged in users to create and view posts. To build an app like this you would need the following:
- A way for users to login and logout
- A way for users to create posts
- A way for users to like posts

For sake of simplicity we will just focus on login/logout and viewing posts.

From a GraphQL perspective we will need the following:
- A query to fetch the user's posts

```tsx
const typeDefs = `
type Query {
    posts: [String],
}
`;
```

The `posts` Query will return a list of `String` (one for each post) if the user is logged in.

:::important
We do not add any queries or mutations for login and logout because the SuperTokens middleware exposes APIs that handle this for us.

<PreBuiltOrCustomUISwitcher>

<PreBuiltUIContent>

Refer to the [backend pre-built UI setup guides](../pre-built-ui/setup/backend) if you have not already added the SuperTokens middleware.

</PreBuiltUIContent>

<CustomUIContent>

Refer to the [backend custom UI setup guides](../custom-ui/init/backend) if you have not already added the SuperTokens middleware.

</CustomUIContent>

</PreBuiltOrCustomUISwitcher>

:::

### Create resolvers

We use the `Session` recipe from `supertokens-node` to verify that the user is logged in with the `getSession` function

```tsx
import Session from "supertokens-node/recipe/session";

const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        posts: async (_: any, __: any, contextValue: any) => {
            // getSession will throw an error if the session does not already exist
            let session = await Session.getSession(contextValue.req, contextValue.res);
            let userId = session.getUserId();
            // TODO: Fetch all posts for the user using the userId
            return [];
        }
    },
}
```

:::note
In the code above we read `req` and `res` from `contextValue`, refer to the next step to see how this is being added to the graphql context
:::

Refer to the [official Apollo guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/schema) to know more about creating queries, mutations and resolvers.

## d) Add the Apollo middleware and SuperTokens error handler to your server

### Setting up Apollo server

Now that we have our schema setup, we need to create an instance of the Apollo server. 

The SuperTokens SDK can throw errors (for example if the user is not logged in) which need to handled in a specific way. By default Apollo handles all errors by returning a HTTP status `200` and the description of the error, which is not supported by the SuperTokens frontend SDKs.

To work around this we create a custom plugin for the Apollo server that will handle errors thrown by the SuperTokens SDK, all other errors will be handled as they normally would by Apollo. The `errorHandler` exposed by the SuperTokens backend SDK will identify if an error is thrown by the SDK itself and handle it accordingly.

```tsx
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server";
import express from "express";
import {errorHandler} from "supertokens-node/framework/express/index.js";

let app = express();

const typeDefs = '' // TODO: Refer to previous step
const resolvers = {} // TODO: Refer to previous step

// highlight-start
const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
    plugins: [
        {
            requestDidStart: async () => {
                return {
                    didEncounterErrors: async (requestContext) => {
                        const {req, res} = requestContext.contextValue as any;
                        for (let i = 0; i < requestContext.errors.length; i++) {
                            let error = requestContext.errors[i].originalError;
                            await new Promise(async (resolve) => {
                                // This will handle any session or other SuperTokens related errors
                                await errorHandler()(error, req, res, (err) => {
                                    resolve(undefined);
                                });
                            });
                        }
                    },
                };
            }
        }
    ],
})
// highlight-end
```

### Adding the Apollo middleware

:::info
When using Apollo server, you must use `expressMiddleware` in order to use SuperTokens because `startStandaloneServer` does not let you configure custom CORS settings
:::

```tsx
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server";
import express from "express";
import { expressMiddleware } from "@apollo/server/express4";
import {errorHandler} from "supertokens-node/framework/express/index.js";

let app = express();

const typeDefs = '' // TODO: Refer to previous step
const resolvers = {} // TODO: Refer to previous step

const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
    plugins: [
        // TODO: Refer to the previous section
    ],
})

server.start().then(() => {
    // highlight-start
    // Use expressMiddleware only after server.start has resolved
    app.use(express.json(), expressMiddleware(server, {
        context: async ({req, res}) => {
            return {
              // We add this so that we can access sessions in the resolvers
                req,
                res,
            };
        },
    }))
    // highlight-end

    app.listen(3001, () => {
        console.log("Server started");
    })
})
```

:::important
We add the request and response objects to the GraphQL context object when using `expressMiddleware`. These are then used in the resolvers in the previous steps along with the Session recipe for supertokens-node.
:::

Refer to [this page](../common-customizations/sessions/session-verification-in-api/verify-session#the-session-object) to know more about the session object
