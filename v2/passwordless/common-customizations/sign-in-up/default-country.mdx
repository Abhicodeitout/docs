# Setting default country for phone inputs

By setting a default country that would fits most of your users (or in case of SSR this can be done based on the current ip of the user) you can enchance their user experience. This setting changes two things:
- If your app only allows phone number based authentication, the phone number form will be prefilled with the appropriate international calling code and have the country selected.
- If your app allows users to use both email addresses and phone numbers, then if an input doesn't pass the validation for either email or phone numbers, then the library will try to get an international number based on the default country. For more details please look [here](./guess-phonenumber).
