# OTP and Magic Link expiration

You can change how long a user can use an OTP or Magic Link to log in by changing the `passwordless_code_lifetime` configuration value of the Core. 

This value is set as milliseconds and defaults to `900000` (15 minutes).

:::caution

This setting doesn't limit how long a login attempt is kept alive - the user can extend the lifetime of any login attempt that hasn't been cleaned up by hitting resend.
