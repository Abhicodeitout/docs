Our frontend SDK handles everything for you. You only need to make sure that you have called `supertokens.init` before making any network requests.

Our SDK adds interceptors to `fetch` and `XHR` (used by `axios`) to save and add session tokens from and to the request.

:::note
By default, our web SDKs use cookies to provide credentials.
