We provide the following methods:
- **Your own Twilio account**
    - The SDK allows you to pass in your Twilio account credentials using which it will send SMSs. The SMSs content is written by us, but you can change them if you like.

- **SuperTokens paid service**
    - You can sign up on supertokens.com, create a production environment and get an SMS API key. You can then provide this key to the SDK and SMSs will be sent from our servers without any rate limits.
    - Over time, we will optimise this service to use location specific providers (for reducing cost), and to prevent all kinds of spamming and misuse.
    - Note that this is a paid service, and we will charge you for every SMS (similar to how Twilio works). We also provide new users with $10 worth credits.

- **Custom method**
    - Using this method, you can create and send the SMS however you like, using any service. Here, you provide a callback to the SDK whose input is the SMS content. We leave it up to you to actually create and send the SMS.

**You can learn more about each of these methods in the SMS delivery section (Find it in the navigation list on the left).**

:::note Default behaviour
By default, the SDK will send SMSs using our (`https://api.supertokens.com`) APIs. This is a free service to send SMSs and is rate limited to 50 SMSs per day across all users. Therefore, it's only meant for development and demo purposes. Once the limit is reached, the SDK will output the SMS content on the terminal.

We provide this so that it's easier for you to get started.
