We provide the following methods:
- **Configure your SMTP credentials / info**
    - The SDK allows you to pass in any SMTP server's information and credentials. Using this, you can send email templates designed by us using your own domain. You can also provide your own email designs.
- **Custom method**
    - Using this method, you can create and send your emails however you like, using any service. Here, you provide a callback to the SDK whose input is the email content. We leave it up to you to actually create and send the email.

**You can learn more about each of these methods in the Email delivery section (Find it in the navigation list on the left).**

:::note Default behaviour
By default, the SDK will send emails using our (`https://api.supertokens.com`) APIs. This is a free service and sends emails from `no-reply@supertokens.com`. The design of these emails is not customisable at the moment.

We provide this so that it's easier for you to get started.
