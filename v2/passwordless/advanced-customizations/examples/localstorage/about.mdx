# Localstorage instead of cookies

Using the features in the "advanced customizations" section, we can customize the SDK to use localstorage instead of cookies for session management. 
This may be necessary if you want your API and website base domains to be (e.g.: `api.example.com` and `xyz.com`), because in this case Safari blocks our cookies. This is not the recommended solution, for more details please check out [this issue](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/issues/280).

You can find the complete example on [GitHub](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-localstorage).

## How the modification works

We need to switch to header-based session in order to access the refresh and access tokens. This way, the frontend can store them in localstorage or wherever desired and use them to authenticate requests.

:::caution
Storing tokens in localstorage comes with a few drawbacks:

-   Increased damage potential of XSS attacks because they can now access the longer-term refresh token
-   Expired tokens are not automatically removed
-   No session info during server-side rendering
-   You can't share sessions across subdomains

For a detailed comparison, please see [our blog](https://supertokens.com/blog/cookies-vs-localstorage-for-sessions-everything-you-need-to-know)

### Backend

On the backend no changes are necessary, as defaults will allow the front-end to use header based authentication.

### Frontend

We need to provide a `cookieHandler` during the initialization of the `Session` recipe.
