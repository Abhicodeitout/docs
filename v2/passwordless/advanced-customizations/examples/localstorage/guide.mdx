# Step-by-step guide

In this guide, we'll modify an [example application](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-emailpassword) to use localstorage instead of cookies.
You can find the modified application [here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/)

## Backend

No modifications required

## Frontend
On the front end, we need to modify our SuperTokens configuration to add a custom `cookieHandler`. 

You can find a simple implementation in [lines 40-57](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/src/App.tsx#L40-L57).
Please keep in mind that this isn't an equivalent replacement for cookies; there are many features we didn't implement in the example. Our recommendation is to use cookies if possible.

You can find the modified `App.js` [here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/src/App.tsx).
