# 1. Frontend Setup


## 1) Finish the [Quick Setup > Frontend](../../quick-setup/frontend) guide.

## 2) AWS API gateway config

In the API gateway, you will need to specify a [stage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/stages.html) which will scope your API endpoints. For example, you may have a stage name per dev env: one for development (`/dev`), one for testing (`/test`) and one for prod (`/prod`). In this case, you need to set the `apiGatewayPath` config param to that stage name like so:

```js
appInfo: {
    appName: "...",
    apiDomain: "...",
    websiteDomain: "...",
__HIGHLIGHT__    apiGatewayPath: "/dev" __END_HIGHLIGHT__
}
```
- Learn more about `apiGatewayPath` [here](../../appinfo)
- An example of this can be found [here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-aws-lambda/frontend/src/App.tsx#L31)
