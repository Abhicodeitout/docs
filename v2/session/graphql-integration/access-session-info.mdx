# Access Session Info In GraphQL Operations

The `getSession` function from the `Session` recipe allows you to fetch session information from the current request. If a session does not exist, `getSession` will throw an error which will be handled by the error handler we setup in the [previous steps](./backend-setup)

```tsx
import Session from "supertokens-node/recipe/session";

const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        verify: async (_: any, __: any, contextValue: any) => {
            let session = await Session.getSession(contextValue.req, contextValue.res);
            // Read information from the `session` object
            return "Session exists";
        }
    },
    
    // ...
}
```

:::note
In the code above we read `req` and `res` from `contextValue`, refer to the [backend setup](./backend-setup) to see how this is being added to the graphql context
