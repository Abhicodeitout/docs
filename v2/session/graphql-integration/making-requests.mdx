# Making Requests

:::info
SuperTokens uses cookies for session verification. This means that no additional token required when making requests
:::

## Using fetch

SuperTokens adds request and response interceptors for fetch automatically, this is also applicable for any GraphQL clients that use fetch internally (for example Apollo). No additional steps are required.

## Using axios
