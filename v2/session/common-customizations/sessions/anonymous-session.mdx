# Anonymous / Guest sessions

With anonymous sessions, you can keep track of user's action / data before they login, and then transfer that data to their post login session.

Anonymous sessions have different properties than regular, logged in sessions:
- The userID of anonymous sessions doesn't matter
- The security constraints on anonymous sessions is lesser than regular sessions, cause you would want users to be logged in before doing anything sensitive anyway.
- Each visitor that visits your app / website gets an anonymous session if they don't have one previously. This does not require them to be logged in.
- We do not want to store anonymous sessions in the database since we run the risk of flodding the db with several sessions that are not that useful to the app.

Given the different chaacteristics of anonymous sessions, using a simple, long lived JWT is a perfect use case. They can be used to store any information about user's activity, and they don't occupy any database space either.

We can issue JWTs using the Session recipe's `Session.createJWT` function as shown below:
