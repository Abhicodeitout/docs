# Adding custom claims to the JWT

:::caution
JWTs are exposed to the frontend, they should not be used as a way to store sensitive information
:::

### Adding your own claims

When using the JWT feature you can add custom claims to the JWT by using our override feature.

```jsx
let SuperTokens = require("supertokens-node");
let Session = require("supertokens-node/recipe/session");

SuperTokens.init({
    supertokens: {...},
    appInfo: {...},
    recipeList: [
        Session.init({
            //highlight-start
            jwt: {
                enable: true,
            },
            override: {
                functions: function (originalImplementation) {
                    return {
                        ...originalImplementation,
                        createNewSession: async function (input) {
                            input.accessTokenPayload = {
                                ...input.accessTokenPayload,
                                role: "user",
                            };

                            return originalImplementation.createNewSession(input);
                        },
                    };
                }
            },
            //highlight-end
        })
    ]
});
```

The above example would add a `role` claim to the JWT.

:::info
Custom claims are added to both the JWT and the access token payload, this lets you access the information without decoding the JWT. Note that the example above will result in a JWT with the `role` claim for every session that is created.
:::

### Claims added by SuperTokens

SuperTokens adds some claims to JWT payloads:

- `sub`: The userId is stored in the JWT under the `sub` claim
- `iss`: The issuer URL is stored under this claim. Read more [here](./enabling-jwts#using-a-custom-issuer) for information on what the default value is and how to configure it.
- `exp`: The time since epoch (in seconds) after which the JWT is considered as expired
- `iat`: The time since epoch (in seconds) when the JWT was created

:::info
You can override the default `sub` and `iss` claims by providing your own as custom claims
