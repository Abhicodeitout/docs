# Option 2. Using claim validators

## What are session claims?
SuperTokens session has a property called `accessTokenPayload`. This is a `JSON` object that's stored in a user's session which can be accessed on the frontend and backend. The key-values in this JSON payload are called claims.

## What are session claim validators?

Session claim validators check if the the claims in the session meet a certain criteria before giving access to a resource.

Let's take two examples:
- 2FA session claim validator: This validator checks if the session claims indicates that the user has completed both the auth factors or not.
- Email verification claim validator: This checks if the user's session indicates if they have verified their email or not.

In either case, the claim validators base their checks on the claims (or properties) present in the session's access token payload. These claims can be added by you or by the SuperTokens SDK (ex, the user roles recipe adds the roles claims to the session).

This document will guide you through how to use prebuilt session claims and session claims validators as well as how to build your own.

## Why do we need session claim validators?
The claims in the payload represent the state of the user's access properties. Session claim validators ensure that the state is up to date when the claims are being checked.

For example, if during sign in, the user has the role of `"user"`, this will be added to their session by SuperTokens. If during the course of their session, the user is upgraded to an `"admin"` role, then the session claim needs to be updated to reflect this as well. To do this automatically, the claim validator for roles will auto refresh the role in the session periodically. You can even specify that you want to force refresh the state when using the validator in your APIs.

Without a special construct of session claim validators, the updating of the session claims would have to be done manually by you (the developer), so to save you the time and effort, we introduced this concept.
