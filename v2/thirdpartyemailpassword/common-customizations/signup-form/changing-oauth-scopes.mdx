# Changing OAuth Scopes

If you would like to add additional OAuth Scopes when accessing your third party provider, you can do so by adding them to the config when initializing the backend SDK.

For example if you are using Google as your third party provider, you can add additional scope as follows:

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```jsx

Supertokens.init({
    supertokens: {...},
    appInfo: {...},
    recipeList: [
        ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init({
            providers: [
                ThirdPartyEmailPassword.Google({
                    clientSecret: "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET",
                    clientId: "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
                    scope: [
                        "additionalFeatureURL",
                    ]
                })
            ]
        })
    ]
});

```
</TabItem>
</BackendSDKTabs>
