# Adding Extra Fields ðŸ’¥

## Step 1: Front End ðŸšª

Currently, your Sign-up form contains only email and password fields.
But you might want to get more information from your customers on sign up.
Let's see how you can extend the Sign-up form to fit your needs.

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```js
SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {...},
    recipeList: [
        ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init({
            signInAndUpFeature: {
                signUpForm: {
                    // highlight-start
                    formFields: [{
                        id: "name",
                        label: "Full name",
                        placeholder: "First name and last name"
                    }, {
                        id: "age",
                        label: "Your age",
                        placeholder: "How old are you?",
                    }, {
                        id: "country",
                        label: "Your country",
                        placeholder: "Where do you live?",
                        optional: true
                    }]
                }
                // highlight-end
            }
        }),
        Session.init()
    ]
});
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

Please refer to the <a href="../../../auth-react/emailpassword/config/sign-up#signupform-config-values" target="_blank">auth-react reference API</a>  for more information about adding custom fields.

## Step 2: Back End ðŸ“«

### Add fields to SuperTokens `init`
Now that you have added new fields to the front end you need to make sure that the backend will take them into account when your new users register.

Go back to where you have called the SuperTokens init function in your NodeJs application:

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```js
SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {...},
    supertokens: {...},
    recipeList: [
        ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init({
            signUpFeature: {
                // highlight-start
                formFields: [{
                  id: "name"
                }, {
                  id: "age"
                }, {
                  id: "country",
                  optional: true
                }]
                // highlight-end
            }
        }),
        Session.init({...})
    ]
});
```
</TabItem>
</BackendSDKTabs>

### Handle form fields on successful Sign-up

Have a look at [this section](../handling-signinup-success#3-handling-signin-signup-event-on-the-backend) that talks about post sign up callback.

:::caution
Supertokens is not applying any processing to those custom fields. That means you should sanitize all the fields.
