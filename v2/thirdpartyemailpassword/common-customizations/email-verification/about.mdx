# Enable email verification

Email verification is turned off by default.

It is strongly encouraged to enable it to ensure the authenticity of your users.

When your users sign up with third party providers, SuperTokens make sure that the email they are using is verified. If it's not the case, SuperTokens will render the email verification page and initiate the email verification flow.

Here is how to turn on email verification from your front end application:

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```js
// in your frontend code

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {...},
    recipeList: [
        ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init({
            // highlight-start
            emailVerificationFeature: {
                mode: "REQUIRED"
            }
        }),
        // highlight-end
        Session.init()
    ]
});
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

When a new user sign up with an unverified email, they will receive an email to verify their address and be redirected to the following screen:

<img width="700px" src="/img/emailpassword/verify-email-screen.png" />

After they have clicked on the email, they will see this screen:

<img width="700px" src="/img/emailpassword/email-verification-successful.png" />

:::note
If you are already using SuperTokens in production and turn on email verification, your users will be redirected to the email verification screen next time they use your application.
