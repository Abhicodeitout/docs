# What is SAML?

SAML, or Security Assertion Markup Language, is an open protocol that is used to exchange information between the auth server and the client application. Some identity providers require OAuth 2.0 for user login, some require SAML, and some can work with both.

## How does SAML work?

<!-- TODO: need to verify this -->

In a nutshell, your SAML identity provider will provide a signing certification (which is a .xml file) which you need to upload to the SAML client (i.e. to SuperTokens or any other SAML client you use).

The `.xml` file contains:
- A unique signature that you must keep private. This is used by the SAML provider to identity your application.
- Information about where to redirect the end user to when they click on the login button in your application. This URL will be to a website that is controlled by the SAML provider and will ask the end user for their credentials.
