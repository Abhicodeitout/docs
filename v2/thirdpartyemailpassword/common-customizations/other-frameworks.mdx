If your backend framework is not supported by SuperTokens, you can follow this guide on setting up an authentication server to protect your frontend and backend.

To illustrate how this setup works, lets take an example:
- The user has a React based frontend and a php backend server.
- SuperTokens does not have a php SDK, so we spin up a separate service to act as an authentication server. This server will be used to handle authentication requests and the issuing of access and refresh tokens. 
- This authentication server can be written as a NodeJS, Python or Golang server. For this example we will be using NodeJS.
- You can follow our quick setup guide on [setting up the NodeJS server](../pre-built-ui/setup).
- Authentication requests like sign-up or sign-in from your React frontend will query the NodeJS authentication server. This
