If your backend framework is not supported by SuperTokens, you can follow this guide on setting up an authentication server to protect your frontend and backend.

To illustrate how this setup works, lets take an example:
- The user has a React based frontend and a php backend server.
- The React frontend integrates with [SuperTokens frontend SDK], but, SuperTokens does not have a php SDK, so we spin up a separate service to act as an authentication server. This server will be used to handle authentication requests and the issuing of access and refresh tokens. 
- The authentication server can be written as a NodeJS, Python or Golang server. For this example we will be using NodeJS.
- You can follow our [quick setup guide on setting up the NodeJS server](../pre-built-ui/setup).
- The architecture of setup should have the following design:

![SuperTokens Setup With Authentication server](/img/other-framework-setup.png)

- In the architecture above the the React Frontend communicates with the php and node server through a reverse proxy.
- Authentication requests like sign-up or sign-in are routed to the NodeJS server while regular requests are sent to the php server.
- The php server can verify incoming requests by [verifying the JWT sent along with the request](./sessions/with-jwt/jwt-verification).


:::important
The method mentioned above assumes that the authentication server is running on the same domain as the  php server but is accessible through a separate path. If your authentication server runs on a separate subdomain, you will need to [enable cookie sharing](./sessions/multiple-api-endpoints) so that cookies are also attached to requests to the php server.
