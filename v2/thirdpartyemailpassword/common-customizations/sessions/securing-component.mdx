# Securing a website route / component
You may want to prevent rendering of some part of UI, or a route, when
there's no session.

To achieve that, wrap the component tree in `ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth`. When there's no session, this component
will redirect the user to the login page.

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```jsx
const App = () => {
    return (
        <ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth>
            {/* MyComponent will be displayed only if session exists */}
            <MyComponent />
        </ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth>
    );
}
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>
