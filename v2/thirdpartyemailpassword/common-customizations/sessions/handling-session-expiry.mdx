# Handling session expiry
There are two scenarios in which session is removed:
1. When session expires
2. When user signs out

This is used to respond to first scenario, **when session expires**.

## Using `ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth` component
When you use `ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth` to provide `SessionContext` to your components,
you can pass function in `onSessionExpired` prop. This function will be called when session expires.

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```js
const App = () => {
    return (
        <ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth onSessionExpired={showSessionExpiredPopup}>
            <MyComponent />
        </ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth>
    );
}
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

:::important
You will need to either reload the current page or redirect the user to the sign in page if you provide this callback.
