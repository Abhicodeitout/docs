# Getting public keys for JWT verification

TODO Docs:
- Basic overview of what this is
- Option 1a: Using the JWKS URL, explaining that tge URL is always on their API domain
- Option 1b: Using the recipe function directly
- Option 2: Setting the public key manually. This will involve Option 1 as well (to get the key)
- Explain that the JWKS URL uses a single key for now but this should not be considered as an assumption? (Auth0 does this but maybe we dont need to)
