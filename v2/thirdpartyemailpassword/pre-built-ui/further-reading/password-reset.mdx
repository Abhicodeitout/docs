# Password Reset

There are two forms to the reset password flow:
- Enter email form
- Enter new password form


## Enter email form
This is shown when the user clicks on the "Forgot password" button in the sign in form. You can view it if you visit `/${websiteBasePath}/reset-password` path of your website (default value of `${websiteBasePath}` is `/auth/reset-password`).

Once the user enters their email and clicks on the "Email me" button, SuperTokens will send them an email only if that email is associated with an account. Regardless, the user will always see a success state:
