# About

The steps to implementation are:
1. Frontend setup
2. Backend config setup
3. Creating an auth serverless function to expose SuperTokens APIs to the frontend
4. Using SuperTokens functions in your APIs (for example for session verification).
5. Next steps

## [An example app using SuperTokens with Netlify is here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-netlify) 
- This example follows the "emailpassword" recipe.

:::note
This guide assumes that you are using Netlify for hosting your serverless API functions. If this is not the case, and you are only hosting your frontend using Netlify, please follow the [Quick setup guide](../../quick-setup/frontend) instead.
