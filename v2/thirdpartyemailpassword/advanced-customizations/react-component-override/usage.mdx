# How to use

1. Go to a place where you run `ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init(...)` to configure the recipe.
2. Component overrides can be configured at `override.components` config object path.
3. Pick component that you'd like to override by its key.
4. At component's key supply a React component that would receive original props and default component

## Example
<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init({
    override: {
        components: {
            /**
             * In this case, the <EmailPasswordSignIn> will render the default component
             * wrapped in div with octocat picture above it.
             */
            EmailPasswordSignIn: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                return (
                    <div>
                        <img src="octocat.jpg" />
                        <DefaultComponent {...props} />
                    </div>
                );
            },
        },
        emailVerification: {
            components: {
                // Please refer to Overriding email verification components below
            }
        }
    }
});
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

## Which component I can override?
For the full list of components available for override in `ThirdPartyEmailPassword` recipe, refer to
[auth-react ThirdPartyEmailPassword override docs](/docs/auth-react/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/override/components).

## Finding which component will be overridden
To do that, you should use React Developer Tools extension which provides a component tree inspector.
In this inspector look for components specified above.

### Example
<img src="/img/emailpassword/override/find-component.png" />

1. Look for the names defined in component override config
2. Ensure that's the component you want to override
3. Provide an override function

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init({
    ...,
    override: {
        components: {
            EmailPasswordSignIn: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                return <CustomComponent {...props} />
            },
        }
    }
})
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

## The signature of override function
Override function is a React Component factory function. It will receive original component
as a parameter, in case you want to render it. It should return a React Component, which will receive
original props.

```tsx
const overrideFn = React.Component<OriginalProps & { DefaultComponent: /* default component type */ }>
```

## How do I render the original component
Because the override function receives the original component as a parameter,
you can render it. To do this, simply use it in JSX. Don't forget to supply original props
by spreading them.

```tsx
const overrideFn = ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>I'm a header that you added above original component</h1>
            <DefaultComponent {...props} />
        </>
    )
}
```

## Overriding email verification components
You can also override components related to email verification.
To do that, nest the override configuration like:

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init({
    override: {
        emailVerification: {
            components: {
                EmailVerificationSendVerifyEmail: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                    return <div>
                        <DefaultComponent {...props} />
                    <div>
                }
            }
        }
    }
})
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

For the full list refer to [auth-react EmailVerification override docs](/docs/auth-react/docs/emailverification/override/components).
