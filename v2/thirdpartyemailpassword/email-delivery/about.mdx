# Email Delivery services

The following emails are sent by this recipe:
- Password reset
- Email verification (if enabled)

In this section, we will explore how to customise the design and delivery method of these emails.

## Method 1) Default behaviour
If you provide no configuration for email delivery, the backend SDK sends email by talking to our servers, on `https://api.supertokens.com` (for both self hosted and managed versions). You can see the default email UI here:
- Default [email verification template](../common-customizations/email-verification/email-verification-email) and its [source code](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates/blob/master/email-html/email-verification.html).
- Default [password reset template](../common-customizations/reset-password/password-reset-email) and its [source code](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates/blob/master/email-html/password-reset.html).

:::important
- We do not log / store any of the info sent to our API that send out emails on behalf of your app.
- Emails are sent using `no-reply@supertokens.com` email ID. If you want to use your own domain, please see one of the other methods to sending email listed in this section.

## Method 2) Use your own domain / SMTP server
Using this method, you can provide your own SMTP server's config and the emails will be sent using those. Use this method if you want to:
- Send emails using your own domain.
- Optionally customise the default email template.

Learn more about this method in the [SMTP section](./smtp/configure-smtp).

## Method 3) Take full control of email sending
This method allows you provide a callback using which you can send emails however you like. The input to the callback will the variable contents of the email, so you freely design the email as well. Use this method if you are:
- Using a third party email service like Mailchimp.
- You want to do some custom spam protection before sending the email.
- You already have an email sending infrastructure and want to use that.

Learn more about this method in the [Custom section](./custom/configure).
