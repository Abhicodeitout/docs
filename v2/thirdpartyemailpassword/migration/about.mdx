In this guide we will be going through the process of migrating users from an external Authentication provider to SuperTokens.

To get started, you will first need to setup SuperTokens on your frontend and backend. You can do so by following the [quick setup](/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/quick-setup/frontend).

There are 2 steps to user migration:

- Account Creation
  - User Creation
  - UserId Mapping
  - Email Verification 
- Session Migration

## Step 1) Account Migration:

## Step 2) Session Migration

- If you have users with an existing sessions you can use the following guide to migrate their external provider sessions to a SuperTokens session.
- This will result in the user's external provider session being revoked and a new SuperTokens session being created.

You can learn more about how to implement these changes in the [Session Migration](./session-migration) section
