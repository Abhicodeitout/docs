# User Creation

*Brief description about creating users*

## Email Password Migration:

*We support importing users with password hashes generated with Argon2, BCrypt and Firebase SCrypt.
 If you use a password hashing algoithm we dont support or dont have access to your password hashes then link to guide*

### Migrating users With Argon2 or BCrypt Password hashes

SuperTokens allows you to import users with password hashes generated with `BCrypt`, `Argon2` and `Firebase SCrypt` with our import user API.
You can find the API spec [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/supertokens/CDI/2.16.0#/EmailPassword%20Recipe/userImport).

For users with `BCrypt` or `Argon2` password hashes you can use the following curl command to import your user.

```bash
curl -XPOST -H 'api-key: your_api_key' -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{ 
 "email": "johndoe@gmail.com",
  "passwordHash": "passwordHash",
  "hashingAlgorithm": "argon2"
}' 'https://your_supertokens_connection_url/recipe/user/passwordhash/import'
```

### Migrating users with Firebase SCrypt Password hashes

Importing users from Firebases requires an update to your supertokens core config and formatting the input password hash.

- Step 1: Retrive your Firebase password hashing parameters from your dashboard.

- Step 2: Update the config of your SuperTokens core instance to include the `base64_signer_key` from your firebase hashing parameters.
