# Mark email as verified

- Once a SuperTokens user has been created and their userId has been mapped, you need to mark their email as verified (if applicable) so that they do not have to go through the email verification process again.
- We can do so by calling the SuperTokens core's APIs.

There are two parts to verifying a user's email:
- Generating an email verification token.
- Verifying the users email with the verification token.

## Generating the email verification token:

For example with the email as `johnDoe@gmail.com` and userId as `056f4b02-c992-42ed-a8af-cb709669bbd`

```bash
curl -XPOST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{
  "email": "johnDoe@gmail.com",
  "userId": "056f4b02-c992-42ed-a8af-cb709669bbd"
}' '^{coreInjector_uri_without_quotes}/recipe/user/email/verify/token'
```

Successfully generating an email verification token will result in the following response 

```
{
    "status":"OK",
    "token":"OWU2OGQyZWQ5MGFkMzM1M2Y4ZDMzNjE1NzA4ZGI0YWYyODEwMzg0NjJhNTcxNDZjYmY0NzJiOTZmYWE5OTJkMzRmOWVkYzBiODZkMWNmYTJkY2I5YWJkZDU2Yjg0NTU0"    
} 
```

## Verifying the users email with the verification token 

Retrieve the token from the response of the previous request and set it in the body of the email verification request.

```bash
curl -XPOST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{
  "method": "token",
  "token": "OWU2OGQyZWQ5MGFkMzM1M2Y4ZDMzNjE1NzA4ZGI0YWYyODEwMzg0NjJhNTcxNDZjYmY0NzJiOTZmYWE5OTJkMzRmOWVkYzBiODZkMWNmYTJkY2I5YWJkZDU2Yjg0NTU0"
}' '^{coreInjector_uri_without_quotes}/recipe/user/email/verify'
```
