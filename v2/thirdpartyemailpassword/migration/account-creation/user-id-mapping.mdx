# UserId Mapping
<CoreInjector>

- For user's who have stored information against existing userIds in their application tables and are now migrating their users over to SuperTokens, UserId Mapping will allow you to map the existing userIds to the SuperTokens userIds. 
- Once mapped you can interact with all of SuperTokens APIs and functions using the exisiting userIds.

## Map your user's existing userId to their new SuperTokens userId.

For example:
With the user's SuperTokens userId as `fa7a0841-b533-4478-95533-0fde890c3483` and externalId as `customUserId`.

```bash
curl -XPOST -H 'api-key: your_api_key' -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{ 
  "superTokensUserId": "fa7a0841-b533-4478-95533-0fde890c3483",
  "externalUserId": "externalId",
}' '^{coreInjector_uri_without_quotes}/recipe/userid/map'
```
