# About

In this guide we will go through the process of migrating your users from Auth0 to SuperTokens.

There are two steps for migrating users:

1. Account Migration
2. Session Migration


## Step 1: Account Migration

- We will be overriding the SuperTokens login function to check that if a user logs in with with their Auth0 account credentials, a SuperTokens account will be created automatically without having to go through the sign up process.
- This will result in users who try to login with their Auth0 credentials, being able to directly sign in with a SuperTokens user account and session being automatically created.
- If you have stored a users Auth0 userId in your database, you can continue to use that data by mapping the users Auth0 userId with their SuperTokens userId.

You can learn more about how to implement these changes in the [Account Migration](./account-migration/modifications-to-login) section.

## Step 2: Session Migration
- If you have users with an existing Auth0 session you can use the following guide to migrate their Auth0 session to a SuperTokens session.
- This will result in the user's Auth0 session being revoked and a new SuperTokens session being created.
