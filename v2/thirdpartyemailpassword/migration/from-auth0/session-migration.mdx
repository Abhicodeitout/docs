# Session Migration

In this section we will go over how to migrate Auth0 user sessions

## Implementation

### Frontend Changes:

- In your frontend, on page load we will first check if an Auth0 session exists. If a session exists we then send a request to a `migrate-session` endpoint on your backend with the Auth0 access token.

### Backend Changes:

- On your backend you will need to configure a `migrate-session` endpoint.
- When the frontend sends a request to this endpoint we first take the token sent in the request and retrive the auth0 userInfo.
- We can then revoke the auth0 session.
- We can extract the Auth0 userId from the the userInfo retrived in the previous step and check if the user exists in SuperTokens( can be done by checking if an associated SuperTokens userId is mapped to the Auth0 userId).
- If a SuperTokens user exists we can create a new session with the associated userId and send a response.
- If no associated user exists we should send a request to the frontend prompting it to signIn the user.
