# How to troubleshoot

## Enable backend logs

:::important
This is only available on versions:
- supertokens-node >= v9.1.2
- supertokens-golang >= v0.5.5
- supertokens-python >= v0.6.3
:::

Our backend SDK provides useful logs that can help with debugging. To enable logging, you need to run the SDK in debug mode:

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

<OSTabs isSubTab={true}>
<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
DEBUG=com.supertokens node index.js

# OR

DEBUG=com.supertokens npm start

# OR

DEBUG=com.supertokens yarn start
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mac">

```bash
DEBUG=com.supertokens node index.js

# OR

DEBUG=com.supertokens npm start

# OR

DEBUG=com.supertokens yarn start
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

```batch
SET DEBUG=com.supertokens
node index.js

# OR

SET DEBUG=com.supertokens
npm start

# OR

SET DEBUG=com.supertokens
yarn start
```
</TabItem>
</OSTabs>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go">

<OSTabs isSubTab={true}>
<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
SUPERTOKENS_DEBUG=1 go run main.go
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mac">

```bash
SUPERTOKENS_DEBUG=1 go run main.go
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

```batch
SET SUPERTOKENS_DEBUG=1
go run main.go
```
</TabItem>
</OSTabs>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

<OSTabs isSubTab={true}>
<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
SUPERTOKENS_DEBUG=1 python app.py
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mac">

```bash
SUPERTOKENS_DEBUG=1 python app.py
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

```batch
SET SUPERTOKENS_DEBUG=1
python app.py
```
</TabItem>
</OSTabs>

</TabItem>
</BackendSDKTabs>

Logs on your terminal have the following shape:
```bash
com.supertokens {"t": "2022-04-09T08:44:49.057Z", "sdkVer": "...", "message": "Started SuperTokens with debug logging (supertokens.init called)", "file": "..."}
```

- `t`: The time the log was generated
- `sdkVer`: Version of the SDK you are using
- `message`: The log message
- `file`: The file and line number from where this log was generated.

## For non-serverless env
You should see a few logs as soon as you start your backend process in debug mode. If you do not see them, it means:
- Either the env var was not set properly
- `supertokens.init` was not called on the backend. You must call the `init` function for the SDK to work as intended.

## For serverless env
You should see logs as soon as you make at least one API request in to a function that calls `supertokens.init`. If you don't see that, it means:
- Either the env var was not set properly
- You missed calling `supertokens.init` for the serverless function. You must call the `init` function for the SDK to work as intended.

## What to do next?
We will be populating this section with common issues faced by our users and tally them with the generated logs so that you can debug issues yourself.

Until then, you can reach out to us on [our Discord](https://supertokens.com/discord), and ask us or the community to help. Please post messages in the following format:

```text
-> Issue: ... (Example: I'm getting an unauthorised error even though the cookies were set during login)

-> Name and version of frontend SDK used: ... (Example: supertokens-website, v1.0.0)

-> Name and version of backend SDK used: ... (Example: supertokens-node, v1.0.0)

-> Debug logs from the backend SDK:

com.supertokens {"t": "...", "sdkVer": "...", "message": "...", "file": "..."}

com.supertokens {"t": "...", "sdkVer": "...", "message": "...", "file": "..."}

com.supertokens {"t": "...", "sdkVer": "...", "message": "...", "file": "..."}

.....
```

:::important
If you are facing an issue when making an API call, please also include the logs generated when that API call is made.
