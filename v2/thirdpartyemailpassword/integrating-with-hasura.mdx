# Integrating with Hasura (THIS WILL BE A SECTION, INDIVIDUAL SECTIONS BECOME PAGES)

NOTE: THIS will require hosting supertokens. 

### Different ways to do auth in Hasura (ABOUT)
1. with JWT (this page)
2. without JWT, via your backend APIs.

### 1. with JWT (this page) (Page 2)
TODO DOCS: 
##### Step 1: Enabling JWT with sessions
- Explain that this requires enabling JWTs (with link to page)
- Steps to follow to generate a JWT with valid claims (link to using sessions with JWT for all steps to follow + Link to hasura for a guide of what claims to add)

##### Step 2: Adding claims to JWT
- Link to Hasura docs for claims and namespace rules
- Example of overriding createNewSession to add custom claims, also mention that they can set claims in the access token payload when calling createNewSession

##### Step 3: Hasura environment variables
- Link to Hasura docs for setting environment variables
- Link to Hasura guide for enabling JWT based auth

##### Step 3a: Using JWKS endpoint
- Setting jwk url link

##### Step 3b: Using key string
- Link to common cusotmisations / sessions / with-jwt / get public key / pem string
- Setting environment variables in hasura config

##### Step 4: Setting up permissions and roles in hasura
- Link to Hasura docs for RBAC

##### Step 5: Making requests to hasura
- Getting access token payload and jwt
- Adding jwt to the authorization header when making requests
- Example code


### PAGE 3: Without jwt
TODO: The idea is to setup a reverse proxy that relays requests from your frontned to hasura, your backend verifies the session and adds the user id or othter claims to each request. Coming Soon

No sensitive token is exposed on the frontend, preventing XSS
