This section describes any default content added to the user context object for you to consume.

### Backend
```text
{
    _default: {
        /* 
        This is the request object that allows you to read the body / origin / headers of the API request.

        It is optional and will be defined only if the function you are overriding is called during an API.
        */
        request
    }
}
```

### Frontend
