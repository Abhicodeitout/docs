# CORS Issues 

## Introduction

In this post, we’ll be talking about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)!

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers, allowing resources such as loading web fonts or making API calls from new domains.

For example, a user is on a website that uses the domain name "example.com". This website uses a font that's hosted on a different domain name, "fonts.com". When the user's browser makes a request for the font from "fonts.com", the browser will first send a "preflight" request to "fonts.com" to check if "fonts.com" is willing to share resources with "example.com".

If "fonts.com" allows cross-origin resource sharing, then the browser will proceed with loading the font. Otherwise, the browser will cancel the request.

CORS is a way for web servers to say "I will accept cross-origin requests from this origin" or "I will not accept cross-origin requests from this origin". CORS is a security measure to prevent malicious scripts from making unauthorized requests.

This is important because cross-origin requests can be quite scary. I could be logged into my bank account and a malicious site could make an AJAX request to the bank site to retrieve my bank balance.

CORS supports these types of cross-origin requests while still maintaining a high level of security. By specifying which origin domains are allowed to make requests and which methods and headers are allowed, we can all browse the web without worrying about our bank information being stolen.


## Handling CORS with Supertokens

With Supertokens, handling CORS is quite simple!

Below is a quick example of how to add CORS to work with Supertokens in an NodeJS (express) app.

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-node";
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
let app = express();

// ...other middlewares

app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
    allowedHeaders: ["content-type", ...SuperTokens.getAllCORSHeaders()],
    methods: ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    credentials: true,
  })  
);

// ...your API routes
```

## Different parts of CORS

Let’s take a step back and talk about what each of these fields mean.

**`origin` [must have]** -

This configures the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` CORS header. It expects a couple input types. For our case, we’ll only talk about what happens when we assign a Boolean or String to this field.

- Boolean - set origin to true to reflect the request origin, as defined by req.header('Origin'), or set it to false to disable CORS.
- String - set origin to a specific origin. For example, once set to "http://example.com" only requests from "http://example.com" will be allowed.

This is important because Supertokens has both a frontend and backend SDK. The frontend SDK calls the APIs exposed by the backend SDK. As a result, if the origin to set to false or the wrong origin, we’ll find an error such as the following -

:::danger
Origin [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Status code: 204
:::

**`allowedHeaders` [optional] -**

This configures the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` CORS header. It expects one of two input types.

- Comma-delimited string - `'X-Custom-Header, Content-Type'`
- Array - `['X-Custom-Header', 'Content-Type']`

For Supertokens projects, we can use the SuperTokens.getCORSAllowedHeaders() function which returns the following list - `["anti-csrf", "rid"]`

This is important because the header tells the browser what HTTP headers are allowed to be used when making a cross-origin request.

**methods [optional] -**

This configures the Access-Control-Allow-Methods CORS header. It expects one of two input types.

- Comma-delimited string - `'GET,PUT,POST'`
- Array - `['GET', 'PUT', 'POST']`

This is important because the header tells the browser what HTTP methods are allowed to be used when making a cross-origin request. Supertokens in particular uses `GET`, `POST` and `PUT` for functions such as creating new accounts, signing in/out etc.

**`credentials` [must have] -**

This configures the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials CORS header. It expects a boolean.

If you set this header to true, then the browser will allow cookies to be sent in cross-origin requests. This is important because cookies are the only way Supertokens can store the user's session. It is required to set this header to true, so that the browser can send cookies to the Supertokens service.

## Common CORS Issues

:::danger
`[Error] Credentials flag is true, but Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is not "true".`
:::

This happens when the CORS credentials field is not set to true.

We can remedy this issue by setting credentials to `true` in our cors setting.

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-node";
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
let app = express();

// ...other middlewares

app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
    allowedHeaders: ["content-type", ...SuperTokens.getAllCORSHeaders()],
    methods: ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    //highlight-start
    credentials: true, // Check this line
    //highlight-end

  })  
);
```

:::danger
[Error] Origin [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Status code: 204
:::

This happens when the CORS origin field is incorrect. Another varient of this error is when the error code is a 404. Generally, that also means a misconfiguration in the CORS origin field. 

We can remedy this issue by ensuring the origin field lines up with the API domain located in other parts of the code. I’ve highlighted them in bold below -

```tsx
// api-server.js

import supertokens from "supertokens-node";
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
import EmailPassword from "supertokens-node/recipe/emailpassword";
import Session from "supertokens-node/recipe/session";
import Dashboard from "supertokens-node/recipe/dashboard";

supertokens.init({
  framework: "express",
  supertokens: {
    connectionURI: "https://try.supertokens.com",
  },

  appInfo: {
    appName: "SuperTokens Demo App",
    //highlight-start
    apiDomain: "http://localhost:8080", // Check this line**
    //highlight-end
    websiteDomain: "http://localhost:3000",
  },
   recipeList: [
      EmailPassword.init(),
      Session.init(),
      Dashboard.init({
        apiKey: "supertokens_is_awesome",
      }),
   ],
});

const app = express();
app.use(
   cors({
      //highlight-start
      origin: "http://localhost:8080", // Check this line
      //highlight-end
      allowedHeaders: ["content-type", ...supertokens.getAllCORSHeaders()],
      methods: ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
      credentials: true,
   })
);
```

```tsx
//App.js
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import EmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/emailpassword";
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";

SuperTokens.init({
 appInfo: {
    appName: "SuperTokens Demo App",
    //highlight-start
    apiDomain: "http://localhost:8080", // Check this line
    //highlight-end
    websiteDomain: "http://localhost:3000",
 },
 recipeList: [
    EmailPassword.init(),
    Session.init()
 ]
});
```

:::danger
[Error] Origin http://localhost:3000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Status code: 200
:::

This happens when the Supertokens middleware is before the CORS middleware. It can also cause an issue in the context of nodejs app where OPTIONS APIs have the right headers, but when you do a POST / GET request to one of the supertokens APIs, it doesn't have the right headers. This is because the CORS middleware doesn't get called if it's placed after the Supertoeksn middleware. To fix, simply put the CORS middleware before the Supertokens middleware.

```tsx
// api-server.js

import supertokens from "supertokens-node";
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
import { middleware, errorHandler } from "supertokens-node/framework/express";

const app = express();

app.use(
   cors({
       origin: "http://localhost:8080",
       allowedHeaders: ["content-type", ...supertokens.getAllCORSHeaders()],
       methods: ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
       credentials: true,
   })
);
//highlight-start
app.use(middleware()); // CORS should be before this line
//highlight-end
```

:::danger
[Error] Cannot use wildcard in Access-Control-Allow-Origin when credentials flag is true.
:::

This appears when CORS is missing the allow-control-access-origin headers. To fix, add in the origin within the CORS settings.

```tsx
// api-server.js

import supertokens from "supertokens-node";
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";

const app = express();

app.use(
   cors({
      //highlight-start
      origin: "http://localhost:8080",  // Add this line in
      //highlight-end
      allowedHeaders: ["content-type", ...supertokens.getAllCORSHeaders()],
      methods: ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
      credentials: true,
   })
);
```

And that’s everything! Thanks for reading and have fun building your next Supertoken app with CORS!
