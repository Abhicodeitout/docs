# Securing a website route / component
You may want to prevent rendering of some part of UI, or a route, when
there's no session.

To achieve that, wrap the component tree in `EmailPasswordAuth`.  When there's no session, this component
will redirect the user to the login page.

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```js
const App = () => {
    return (
        <EmailPasswordAuth>
            {/* MyComponent will be displayed only if session exists */}
            <MyComponent />
        </EmailPasswordAuth>
    );
}
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

Read more about `EmailPasswordAuth` in [its API reference](/docs/auth-react/emailpassword/email-password-auth).
