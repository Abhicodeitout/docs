# Using sessions with JWTs

:::caution
Using JWTs is optional and is only required if you want to integrate with another service that relies on JWTs or if you wanted to integrate with a backend framework that we do not support yet
:::

:::important Note
When using this feature you do not need to create and maintain your own JWT signing keys, SuperTokens generates them for you. Currently only RSA based signing algorithms are supported.
:::

## What does this mean?

When using SuperTokens with this feature enabled, a JWT is created which can be accessed on both the frontend and the backend. This allows you to:

- Integrate SuperTokens with existing systems that use JWT based mechanisms
- Integrate with services that rely on JWT based authentication (For example Hasura)

:::caution Security concerns
Using this feature exposes the generated JWT to the frontend. This makes the token susceptible to XSS attacks, this in turn implies that the token can be stolen and an attacker can use this to query any service that relies on this token. If security is an issue, then do not enable JWT and rely on our default session management which uses httponly cookies.
