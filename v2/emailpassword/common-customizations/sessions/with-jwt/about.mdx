# Using sessions with JWTs

:::important Note
When using this feature you do not need to create and maintain your own JWT signing keys, SuperTokens generates them for you. Currently only RSA based signing algorithms are supported.
:::

### What does this mean?

When using SuperTokens with this feature enabled, a JWT is created which can be access on both the frontend and the backend. This allows you to:

- Integrate SuperTokens with existing systems that use JWT based mechanisms
- Integrate with services that rely on JWT based authentication (For example Hasura)

:::caution Security concerns
Using this feature exposes the generated JWT to the frontend, this makes the token susceptible to XSS attacks.
