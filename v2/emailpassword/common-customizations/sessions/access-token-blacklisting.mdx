# Access token blacklisting

## About

In most cases, when a session is revoked, it's removed from the database and the fronte cookies.

In other cases, it's only removed from the db - in this case, if the access token is still alive, it can be used to query an API, and session verification will be successful (because verification is stateless). This is usually not a problem since the access token's lifetime is small anyway.

However, If you really want to enforce revocation immediately, you should enable this feature. 


## Enabling this feature

:::caution
This will result in making a db call for each session verification attempt, as a result, it may slow down all of your API calls.
:::

You can enable this feature by setting the below config value in the core:

<SelfHostedTabs>
<TabItem value="with-docker">

```bash
 docker run \
    -p 3567:3567 \
    // highlight-next-line
    -e ACCESS_TOKEN_BLACKLISTING=true \ 
    -d supertokens/supertokens-<db name>
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="without-docker">

```yaml
# You need to add the following to the config.yaml file.
# The file path can be found by running the "supertokens --help" command

access_token_blacklisting: true
```
</TabItem>
</SelfHostedTabs>
