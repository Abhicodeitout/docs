# Customising the email sent

## The default email
- From: no-reply@supertokens.com, but the user will see your app name
- Template [source code](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates/blob/master/email-html/email-verification.html).
- Subject: `Email verification instructions`

This is achieved by calling an API provided by us (`https://api.supertokens.com`). The backend SDK calls our API with the verify email link, app name and the email of the end user.

## Customising the email

See the [email delivery](../../email-delivery/about) section for information on different ways to send or customise the email verification email.
