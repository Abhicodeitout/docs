# Overview

In this section, we will see how we can customise this recipe to add username based login with an optional email field to your application.

Whilst this guide shows you how to add an optional email field to the user, if you only want username and password, you can just ignore all the parts relevant to the optional email field.

Please visit the next section to see the set of cutomisations that are required.
