# Translating the UI

You can translate the UI using two main methods:
1. You can override all displayed translation strings by providing translated versions for different languages (and even change the default English version).
2. You can provide a translation function to integrate supertokens with your preferred internationalization library.

## Translation strings

### Providing translation strings

You can provide translations for each segment displayed in our UIs. To see what keys you should cover, please check [here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/lib/ts/recipe/^{codeImportRecipeName}/components/themes/translations.ts).

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import React from "react";
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";

SuperTokens.init({
    // highlight-start
    languageTranslations: { // This object contains all translation related options
        translations: { // These are the displayed translation strings for each language
          // The property names define the language code of the translations
          en: {
            // Here each key is a translation key and the value is the string that will be displayed
            // Setting the value to undefined will either display the translation from the default language or the translation key
            BRANDING_POWERED_BY_START: "We ‚ù§Ô∏è ",
          },
          hu: {
            BRANDING_POWERED_BY_START: "Sok szeretettel: ",
            // This key is associated with an empty string by default, but you can override these as well.
            BRANDING_POWERED_BY_END: " üòä",
          }
        },
        /* 
         * This optional property sets the default and fallback language. 
         * It can be any string that will be used to fetch translations from the above object.
         * Defaults to "en"
         */
        defaultLanguage: "hu", 
    },
    // highlight-end
    appInfo: {
        appName: "...",
        apiDomain: "...",
        websiteDomain: "...",
    },
    recipeList: [
      // ...
    ],
});
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

### Loading translations

After initialization, you can load translations by calling the `SuperTokens.loadTranslation`:

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";

// This method takes an object as a parameter, which is structured the same as above.
// This will be merged into the existing definitions, so any properties missing here won't remove them from the already loaded translations
SuperTokens.loadTranslation({
  en: {
    BRANDING_POWERED_BY_END: " :)",
  }
});
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

### Changing the current language

You can update which translations store is displayed by calling the `SuperTokens.changeLanguage`.

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";

SuperTokens.changeLanguage("hu");
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

## Library integration

You can easily integrate SuperTokens with your internationalization library of choice. You can check out an example using i18next [here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-i18next/src/App.js). To do this you need to do two things:

1. Provide the translation function in `SuperTokens.init`

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import React from "react";
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";

SuperTokens.init({
    languageTranslations: {
        translationFunc: (key: string) => {
          // The string returned by this function will be displayed
          return key + "!";
        },
    },
    appInfo: {
        appName: "...",
        apiDomain: "...",
        websiteDomain: "...",
    },
    recipeList: [
      // ...
    ],
});
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

2. Call `SuperTokens.changeLanguage` or `SuperTokens.loadTranslation` when the language is updated or new translations are loaded

Since the provided `tranlationFunc` is not updated, the SDK will only re-render and update the displayed translation after either of the above functions are called. You can easily do this in event handlers or at the same time as the current language is changed.

## Partial translations

If the SDK can't find a segment in the current language's translation store, we will check the default language store and use the translation from there. If it's missing also missing from the default store, the raw translation key is displayed. For example, this can happen for custom error messages returned by the backend API.

## Saving the chosen language

The currently chosen language is stored in a cookie, this way it can be restored the next time the page loads. The domain of this cookie can be customized through the `currentLanguageCookieScope` option. This can be useful if you are running our SDK in multiple applications and want to share the language choice between sub-domains.

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import React from "react";
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";

SuperTokens.init({
    languageTranslations: {
        currentLanguageCookieScope: "http://localhost"
    },
    appInfo: {
        appName: "...",
        apiDomain: "...",
        websiteDomain: "...",
    },
    recipeList: [
      // ...
    ],
});
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

## Translations in component overrides

The SDK also exports the `useTranslation` React hook you can use while overriding components. It returns a function that takes a translation segment key and returns it translated to the currently selected language. For more information on what translation keys you should use and the exact syntax, please see the original source code of the component you are overriding.
