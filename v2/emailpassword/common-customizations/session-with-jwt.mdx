# Using sessions with JWTs

You can enable the JWT feature when using SuperTokens, this lets you:
- Access a JWT on your frontend application and backend servers
- Easily integrate with services that rely on JWT based authentication (For example Hasura)


:::info Guide
Refer to [this page](./sessions/with-jwt/about) for details about the JWT feature and how to use it.
:::

:::caution Security concerns
Using this feature exposes the generated JWT to the frontend, this makes the token susceptible to XSS attacks.
