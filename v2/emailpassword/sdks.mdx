# SDK Reference

:::important
- This section is only for detailed SDK reference. This section will NOT provide a step by step guide.
- For a step by step guide to implementing SuperTokens, please [pick a recipe](/docs/community/recipes) and follow the setup instructions in there.
:::


## NodeJS (All features supported)

See the [supertokens-node reference documentation](/docs/nodejs/installation) for more information.

## ReactJS (All features supported)

See the [supertokens-auth-react reference documentation](/docs/auth-react/installation) for more information.

## Vanilla JS (Only supports session management - i.e. no login UI)

If you want to only implement session management with SuperTokens, then you can use any frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular etc..) along with our [supertokens-website](/docs/website/installation) SDK.

## Difference between the `supertokens-auth-react` and `supertokens-website` sdks:
- The `supertokens-website` sdk provides session management functionality for your web app.
- The `supertokens-auth-react` sdk is responsible for rendering the login UI widgets and managing sessions automatically. It implements the `supertokens-website` for its session functionality.

### When to use what?
- If you are developing an app with a Reactjs frontend and Nodejs backend which needs authentication, you should use the `supertokens-auth-react` sdk. You can follow this [guide](/docs/community/recipes) to setup authentication in your app.

- If you want to use SuperTokens, but, your frontend framework is not supported, you can use the `supertokens-website` sdk for session management and build the login UI yourself.


## Other frameworks
- For other frontend frameworks / mobile apps, you can build your own UI that talks to your backend APIs exposed via our SDK.
- For other backend frameworks, you can build your own APIs that use the SuperTokens Core.
