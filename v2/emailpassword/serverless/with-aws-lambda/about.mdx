# About

The steps to implementation are:
1. Frontend setup
2. Backend setup
3. Creating an auth serverless function to expose SuperTokens APIs to the frontend
4. AWS API Gateway setup
5. Using SuperTokens functions in your APIs (for example for session verification).
6. Next steps

## [An example app using SuperTokens with AWS lambda is here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-aws-lambda) 
- This example follows the "emailpassword" recipe.
