# Storing data in a session

:::info
A session is created automatically when the user signs in or signs up.
:::

## Types of storage

A session can hold two types of data:
- Access token / JWT payload: 
    - The access token is a signed cookie that can contain any JSON in it (similar to a JWT).
    - This content is instantly accessible (without a db call) post session verification in an API, and is also accessible on the frontend.
    - The contents can be changed anytime post session verification.
    - An example of what can be stored in this is a user's role.
    - By default, the payload contains:
    ```jsx
    {
        userId: string,
        expiryTime: number,
        userData: {
            // you can add custom info in here.
        }
        // ...other fields (which are all implementation details)
    }
    ```
- Session data:
    - This data is stored in the database, mapped against a session (each session has a constant ID called the `sessionHandle`).
    - A `sessionHandle` can be obtained post session verification in an API, after which this data can be fetched / changed.
    - Use this to store any sensitive data associated with a session, that should not be sent to the frontend.
    - The default value is `{}`

## How to store information in a session

You can store info in the access token or in the session data by overriding the `createNewSession` function in the Session recipe:

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```jsx
let SuperTokens = require("supertokens-node");
let Session = require("supertokens-node/recipe/session);

SuperTokens.init({
    SuperTokens: {...},
    appInfo: {...},
    recipeList: [
        ...
        Session.init({
            // highlight-start
            override: {
                functions: (originalImplementation) => {
                    return {
                        ...originalImplementation,
                        createNewSession: async (input) => {
                            let userId = input.userId;

                            // This goes in the access token > userData object
                            input.jwtPayload = {
                                ...input.jwtPayload,
                                someKey: "someValue",
                            };

                            // This is stored in the db against the sessionHandle for this session
                            input.sessionData = {
                                ...input.sessionData,
                                someKey: "someValue",
                            };

                            return originalImplementation.createNewSession(input);
                        },
                    };
                },
            },
            // highlight-end
        })
    ]
});
```
