# Handling session expiry

:::note
A session can expire if:
- The user has been inactive for too long and their refresh token has expired.
- The session has been revoked from the backend, but not the frontend.
:::


## Using the `onSessionExpired` prop
When you use `ThirdPartyAuth` to provide `SessionContext` to your components,
you can pass function in `onSessionExpired` prop. This function will be called when the session expires.

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```jsx
const App = () => {
    return (
        <ThirdPartyAuth onSessionExpired={showSessionExpiredPopup}>
            <MyComponent />
        </ThirdPartyAuth>
    );
}
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

:::important
You will need to either reload the current page or redirect the user to the sign in page if you provide this callback.
