# Adding custom claims to the JWT

:::caution
Using JWTs is optional and is only required if you want to integrate with another service that relies on JWTs or if you wanted to integrate with a backend framework that we do not support yet
:::

:::caution
JWTs are exposed to the frontend, they should not be used as a way to store sensitive information
:::

## Adding your own claims

When using the JWT feature you can add custom claims to the JWT by using our override feature.

```jsx
let SuperTokens = require("supertokens-node");

SuperTokens.init({

            override: {
                functions: function (originalImplementation) {
                    return {
                        ...originalImplementation,
                        createNewSession: async function (input) {
                            input.accessTokenPayload = {
                                ...input.accessTokenPayload,
                                role: "user",
                            };

                            return originalImplementation.createNewSession(input);
                        },
                    };
                }
            },
            //highlight-end
        })
    ]
});

The above example would add a `role` claim to the JWT.

## Claims added by SuperTokens

SuperTokens adds some claims to JWT payloads:

- `sub`: The userId is stored in the JWT under the `sub` claim
- `iss`: The issuer URL is stored under this claim. Read more [here](./enabling-jwts#using-a-custom-issuer) for information on what the default value is and how to configure it.
- `exp`: The time since epoch (in seconds) after which the JWT is considered as expired
- `iat`: The time since epoch (in seconds) when the JWT was created
