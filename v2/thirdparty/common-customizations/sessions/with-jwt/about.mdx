# Using sessions with JWTs

## When to use this feature?

When using SuperTokens our default session management solution will suffice for most use cases. You do not need to use JWTs unless you want to:

- Integrate with services that rely on JWT based authentication (For example Hasura)
- Integrate SuperTokens with a backend framework that we do not support yet

:::caution Security concerns
Using this feature exposes the generated JWT to the frontend. This makes the token susceptible to XSS attacks, this in turn implies that the token can be stolen and an attacker can use this to query any service that relies on this token. If security is very important, then do not enable JWT and rely on our default session management which uses httponly cookies.
