# JWT Expiry

A JWT is valid for as long as the associated access token is valid (in practice it is valid for slightly longer). Session operations affect JWTs in the following way:

- Creating a new session will result in the JWT expiry to be set close to the validity of the access token
- Refreshing the session will reset the expiry of the JWT

:::caution
Expiring an access token will not affect JWT on the frontend
