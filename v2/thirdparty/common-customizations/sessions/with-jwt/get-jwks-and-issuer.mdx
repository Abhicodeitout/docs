# Getting the JWKS endpoint and issuer URLs

:::caution
Using JWTs is optional and is only required if you want to integrate with another service that relies on JWTs or if you wanted to integrate with a backend framework that we do not support yet
:::

## Issuer

By default SuperTokens uses <BackendSDKCasing>{apiDomain}/auth</BackendSDKCasing> as the issuer URL, to change the path use <BackendSDKCasing>apiBasePath</BackendSDKCasing>. If you want to use a custom issuer URL refer to [this page](./enabling-jwts#using-a-custom-issuer)

## JWKS URL

SuperTokens exposes a Json Web Key Set on `{issuer}/jwt/jwks.json`
