# Multitenant and Enterprise SSO login

Multitenant login is a feature that let's you customize login experience for each of your customers. For example, a customer `customer1` hosted on `customer1.yourdomain.com` can have login with `Active Directory` and `Google`, and another customer `customer2` hosted on `customer2.yourdomain.com` can have login with `Okta` and `Facebook`.

This is also the page that you should see if you want to implement sign in with:
- Okta (`thirdPartyId: "okta"`)
- SAML (`thirdPartyId: "boxy-saml"`)
- Active Directory (`thirdPartyId: "active-directory"`)
- Google Workspaces (`thirdPartyId: "google-workspaces"`)
- Or any other workforce IdP
