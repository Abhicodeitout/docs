# What is account deduplication?

Account deduplication is about preventing users from signing up with different methods using the same email. 

As an example, let's say that your app has Google and GitHub login. There exists a user who had signed up with Google using their email ID - `user@gmail.com`). If this user then tries to sign up with GitHub which has this same email (`user@gmail.com`), then your app will disallow this and show them an appropriate message like "Your account already exists via Google sign in. Please use that instead."

This prevents users from creating multiple accounts on your app, which may happen if they forgot their original login method. Preventing this is useful because:
- It affects your app's analytics and user count.
- The user has a bad experience since they are treated as a fresh user even though they may already have interacted with your app before.

## Difference between account deduplication and account linking
Related to this problem is also the concept of account linking. The difference is that whilst deduplication prevents duplicate sign ups, account linking allows duplicate sign ups, but implicitly merges the duplicate accounts into one.

## Next steps
In this section of the docs, we will see how you can easily implement account deduplication using SuperTokens.
