# Enable email verification 

:::info
- Email verification is turned off by default. It is strongly encouraged to enable it to ensure the authenticity of your users.
- If you are already using SuperTokens in production and turn on email verification, your users will be redirected to the email verification screen next time they use your application.
:::

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```jsx

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {...},
    recipeList: [
        ThirdParty.init({
        // highlight-start
            emailVerificationFeature: {
                mode: "REQUIRED"
            }
        }),
        // highlight-end
        Session.init()
    ]
});
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

## The default UI

When a new user sign up with an unverified email, they will receive an email to verify their address and be redirected to the following screen:

<img width="500px" src="/img/emailpassword/verify-email-screen.png" />

After they have clicked on the email, they will see this screen:

<img width="500px" src="/img/emailpassword/email-verification-successful.png" />
