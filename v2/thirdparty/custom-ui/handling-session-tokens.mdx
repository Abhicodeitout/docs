# Handling session tokens

There are two modes ways in which you can use sessions with SuperTokens:
- Using `httpOnly` cookies
- Authorization bearer token.

Our frontend SDK uses `httpOnly` cookie based session for websites by default as it secures against tokens theft via XSS attacks. For other platform like mobile apps, we use a bearer token in the Authorization header by default. This setting can be changed [as described in the token transfer section](../common-customizations/sessions/token-transfer-method)

Our frontend SDK handles everything for you. You only need to make sure that you have called `supertokens.init` before making any network requests.

Our SDK adds interceptors to `fetch` and `XHR` (used by `axios`) to save and add session tokens from and to the request.

By default, our web SDKs use cookies to provide credentials.

## Getting the access token

Our SDK automatically handles adding the access token to request headers. Therefore, there are only two cases in which you might want to get the access token:
- If you want to send the access token to a different API domain than what is configured as the vlaue of `apiDomain`.
- You want to use a non http based protocol like websockets.

You can read the access token using the `getAccessToken` function as shown below. This function will also make sure to refresh the session if the access token has expired.

:::important
If using cookie-based sessions, by default, the access token is not exposed to the frontend (since it's `httpOnly` cookie). So calling the `getAccessToken` function will return an `undefined` value. In order to expose the token to the fronten in cookie based auth, you will need to pass in the `exposeAccessTokenToFrontendInCookieBasedAuth` param on the backend as shown below.

## If not using our frontend SDK 

:::caution
We highly recommend using our frontend SDK to handle session token management. It will save you a lot of time.
:::

In this case, you will need to manually handle the tokens and session refreshing, and decide if you are going to use header or cookie-based sessions.

For browsers, we recommend cookies, while for mobile apps (or if you don't want to use the built-in cookie manager) you should use header-based sessions.

<Question question="Which request authentication mode are you using?">
    
<Answer title="Cookie">

### On login

You should attach the `st-auth-mode` header to calls to the login API, but this header is safe to attach to all requests. In this case it should be set to "cookie".

The login API will return the following headers:
- `Set-Cookie`: This will contain the `sAccessToken`, `sRefreshToken` cookies which will be `httpOnly` and will be automatically mananaged by the browser. For mobile apps, you will need to setup cookie handling yourself, use our SDK or use a header based authentication mode.
- `front-token` header: This contains information about the access token:
    - The userID
    - The expiry time of the access token
    - The payload added by you in the access token.
    
    Here is the structure of the token:
    ```tsx
    let frontTokenFromRequestHeader = "...";
    let frontTokenDecoded = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(escape(atob(frontTokenFromRequestHeader))));
    console.log(frontTokenDecoded);
    /*
    {
        ate: 1665226412455, // time in milliseconds for when the access token will expire, and then a refresh is required
        uid: "....", // user ID
        up: {
            sub: "..",
            iat: ..,
            ... // other access token payload
        }
    }
    
    */
    ```

    This token is mainly used for cookie based auth because you don't have access to the actual access token on the frontend (for security reasons), but may want to read its payload (for example to know the user's role). This token itself is not signed and hence can't be used in place of the access token itself. You may want to save this token in localstorage or in frontend cookies (using `document.cookies`).

- `anti-csrf` header (optional): By default it's not required, so it's not sent. But if this is sent, you should save this token as well for use when making requests.

### Making network requests to protected APIs

The `sAccessToken` will get attached to the request automatically by the browser. Other than that, you need to add the following headers to the request:
- `rid: "anti-csrf"` - this prevents against anti-CSRF requests. If your `apiDomain` and `websiteDomain` values are exactly the same, then this is not necessary.
- `anti-csrf` header (optional): If this was provided to you during login, then you need to add that token as the value of this header.
- You need to set the `credentials` header to `true` or `include`. This is achieved different based on the library you are using to make requests.

An API call can potentially update the `sAccessToken` and `front-token` tokens, for example if you call the `mergeIntoAccessTokenPayload` function on the `session` object on the backend. This kind of update is reflected in the response headers for your API calls. The headers will contain new values for:
- `sAccessToken`: This will be as a new `Set-Cookie` header and will be managed by the browser automatically.
- `front-token`: This should be read and saved by you in the same way as it's being done during login.

### Handling session refreshing
If any of your API calls return with a status code of `401`, it means that the access token has expired. This will require you to refresh the session before retrying the same API call.

You can call the refresh API as follows:

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain>

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/session/refresh' \
--header 'rid: session' \
--header 'Cookie: sRefreshToken=...'
```

:::note
- You may also need to add the `anti-csrf` header to the request if that was provided to you during sign in.
- The cURL command above shows the `sRefreshToken` cookie as well, but this is added by the web browser automatically, so you don't need to add it explicitly.
:::

</AppInfoForm>

The result of a session refresh will be either:
- Status code `200`: This implies a succesful refresh. The set of tokens returned here will be the same as when the user logs in, so you can handle them in the same way.
- Status code `401`: This means that the refresh token is invalid, or has been revoked. You must ask the user to relogin. Remember to clear the `front-token` that you saved on the frontend earlier.

</Answer>

<Answer title="Header (Authorization Bearer)">

### On login

You should attach the `st-auth-mode` header to calls to the login API, but this header is safe to attach to all requests. In this case it should be set to "header".

The login API will return the following headers:
- `st-access-token`: This contains the current access token associated with the session. You should save this in your application (e.g., in frontend localstorage).
- `st-refresh-token`: This contains the current refresh token associated with the session. You should save this in your application (e.g., in frontend localstorage).

### Making network requests to protected APIs

You need to add the following headers to request:
- `authorization: Bearer {access-token}`
- You need to set the `credentials` to `true` or `include`. This is achieved different based on the library you are using to make requests.

An API call can potentially update the `access-token`, for example if you call the `mergeIntoAccessTokenPayload` function on the `session` object on the backend. This kind of update is reflected in the response headers for your API calls. The headers will contain new values for `st-access-token`

These should be read and saved by you in the same way as it's being done during login.

### Handling session refreshing
If any of your API calls return with a status code of `401`, it means that the access token has expired. This will require you to refresh the session before retrying the same API call.

You can call the refresh API as follows:

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain>

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/session/refresh' \
--header 'rid: session' \
--header 'authorization: Bearer {refresh-token}'
```

</AppInfoForm>

The result of a session refresh will be either:
- Status code `200`: This implies a succesful refresh. The set of tokens returned here will be the same as when the user logs in, so you can handle them in the same way.
- Status code `401`: This means that the refresh token is invalid, or has been revoked. You must ask the user to relogin. Remember to clear the `st-refresh-token` and `st-access-token` that you saved on the frontend earlier.
