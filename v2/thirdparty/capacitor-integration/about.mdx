# Capacitor integration with SuperTokens

To integrate SuperTokens with your capacitor app we recommend using [capacitor-supertokens-nextjs-turborepo](https://github.com/RobSchilderr/capacitor-supertokens-nextjs-turborepo) which is a community created template project with SuperTokens already set up for NextJS on the web and mobile using capacitor.
