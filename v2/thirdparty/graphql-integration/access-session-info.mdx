# Access Session Info In GraphQL Operations

GraphQL passes the context object (refer to [backend setup](./backend-setup#e-add-user-information-to-graphql-context)) to your resolvers, you can use this context to set and read session information.

```jsx
var resolvers = {
    foo: (_, context) => {
        if (context.user !== undefined && context.user.userId !== undefined) {
            return "Bar"
        }

        return "Session does not exist"
    }
}
```
