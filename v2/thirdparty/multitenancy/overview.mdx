# Multitenancy Overview

Multitenancy is a form of architecture where multiple clients share the same set of computing resources. Each client in this context is known as a tenant. For example, applications like Slack or Github offer services to various enterprises, which inturn host their own set of users and data. Although the underlying application, there is a logical separation of users and data between the tenants.
