## ThirdParty Migration

To migrate users with social accounts we can simply call the `signInUp` API with the provider Id and the user's third party userId.

For example:

If we were importing a user with Google as their provider with their third party userId being `106347997792363870000`, we can run the following curl command to import the user.  

  ```bash
  curl -POST -H 'api-key: your_api_key' -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{ 
    "thirdPartId": "google",
    "thirdPartyUserId": "106347997792363870000",
    "email": {
      id: "johnDoe@example.com"
    }
  }' '^{coreInjector_uri_without_quotes}/recipe/user/passwordhash/import'
  ```

</CoreInjector>
