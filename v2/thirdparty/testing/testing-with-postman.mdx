# Testing with Postman

The following guide will go over the process of testing backend APIs with Postman. These APIs are automatically exposed via our backend SDK (`/auth/*` path).

#### Backend Setup:

- Make sure that the ThirdParty Recipe is correctly setup in your backend 
- For the examples given below we will be running our backend on domain `localhost` and port `3001`

We will be testing the following actions through Postman:


#### 1. Signup

- The `/auth/signinup` API requires the `redirectURI`, `thirdPartyId` and `code` attributes to be set as a JSON object in the request body. 
  - `redirectURI`: It is the link the user is redirected to after authentication. For example, for sign in with Google, the value of this will be `{websiteDomain}/auth/callback/google`. 
  - `thirdPartyId`: The id used to identify the provider. For example if Google is enabled as a ThirdParty provider its `thirdPartyId` is `google`
  - `code`: The auth code that is sent by the third party provider when the `redirectURI` is called (post auth from their UI). 

- On a successful response, a new user session will be created with session tokens being set in the response and the response body will contain the `user` object, the `createdNewUser` and `status` values as JSON data.

- The following session tokens are set:
  - `sIdRefreshToken`
  - `sAccessToken`
  - `sRefreshToken`

- More information about these cookies can be found [here](../common-customizations/sessions/cookie-consent)

- More information about the API can be found [here](https://github.com/supertokens/frontend-driver-interface/blob/master/v1.8.0.md#signinup-api)



#### 2. Session Verification

- We can also test APIs which require the user to be logged in.

- For example, we have an API used to query user data with the `verifySession` middleware as shown below

```jsx
// The following code snippet is an example API. You do not need to 
// implement it in your app

app.post("/change-user-data", Session.verifySession(), async (req, res) => {
    let userId = req.session.getUserId();
    // mutate some user data
    res.send({
        userId
    })
})

```

- In Postman, set the request type to `POST`.
- Set the URL to `http://localhost:3001/change-user-data`
- In the Header tab, set key `rid` with value `thirdparty`.
- If you have the `antiCsrf` attribute set to `VIA_TOKEN` in your backend SuperTokens config then, in the Postman Header tab, set a key as `anti-csrf` and value as the `anti-csrf` token retrieved from the login response.
- On a successful response, the response body will contain user data.

- In case you query the `/change-user-data` API with an expired `access token`, you will get a `401` response with the message `try refresh token`.

- To generate new session tokens you can use the `/auth/session/refresh` API as shown in the next section.


#### 3. Refreshing Session Tokens

- In case your `access token` expires you can call the `/auth/session/refresh` api to generate a new  `access token` and `refresh token`.

- In Postman, set the request type to `POST`.
- Set the URL to `http://localhost:3001/auth/session/refresh`
- In the Header tab, set key `rid` with value `thirdparty`.
- On a successful response, new session tokens will be set

- You can see the new session tokens by switching to the cookies tab

#### 4. Logout

- The `/auth/signout` API will be used to invalidate the  user sessions. This will clear the session cookies set in postman.

- In Postman, set the request type to `POST`.
- Set the URL to `http://localhost:3001/auth/signout`
- In the Header tab, set key `rid` with value `thirdparty`.
- On a successful response, the session tokens will be cleared from Postman, and from the database
