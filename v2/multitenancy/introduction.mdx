# Multitenancy

Multitenancy is a way to organize your application to support multiple tenants. A tenant is a group of users who share a common access with specific privileges to the application. They are isolated from one another and can only access their specific data. Furthermore, each tenant can have different methods of logging, configured by the tenant, or by you (the application developer).
