# About React component override

This is a feature that allows you to replace specific component, that is rendered by SuperTokens library.

### Example usecases
Use component override if you want to:
- entirely change how the UI looks like
- enhance the default UI
- adjust the placement of component within app layout
- enhance component's behaviour, by using CAPTCHA to reset email, for instance

Read more about usage in [usage guide](./usage).
