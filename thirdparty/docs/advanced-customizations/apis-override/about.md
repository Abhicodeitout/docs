# About APIs override

Overriding of the apis will allow you to change the behaviour of the apis that are used by the backend APIs exposed via our SDK such as:
- Verifying email
- Reseting password
- Refreshing a session
- Signing out
- And more...

### Some common use cases:
- You want to disable the default api implementation.
- You want to send some analytics event or send a welcome email when a user signs up.
