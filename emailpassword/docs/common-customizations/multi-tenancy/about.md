# About multi tenancy

Many b2b apps allocate one subdomain per customer. For example, if my domain is `example.com`, I may allocate one subdomain per customer like `client1.example.com`, `client2.example.com` and so on (`clientN` can also be the client's name instead)...

In this case, there are two choices for architecting login:
- [One login, many sub domains](./one-login-many-sub-domains): A site may have one login page on `example.com/auth` or on `login.example.com` using which all customers can signin / sign up. If `clientN` signs in, they will be redirected to `clientN.example.com`.

- [One login per sub domain](./one-login-per-sub-domain): A site may provide one login per customer domain. So `clientN` logs in via `clientN.example.com/auth` and after signin, they are redirected to `clientN.example.com`.

SuperTokens supports both the methods. Please see the next pages to learn more.
