# Enable email verification

Email verification is turned off by default. It is strongly encouraged to enable it to ensure the authenticity of your users

Here is how to turn on email verification from your front end application:

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--ReactJS-->
```js
SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {...},
    recipeList: [
        EmailPassword.init({
__HIGHLIGHT__            emailVerificationFeature: {
                mode: "REQUIRED"
            }
        }), __END_HIGHLIGHT__
        Session.init()
    ]
});
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

When a new user sign up, they will receive an email to verify their address and be redirected to the following screen:

<img width="700px" src="/docs/static/assets/emailpassword/verify-email-screen.png" />

After they have clicked on the email, they will see this screen:

<img width="700px" src="/docs/static/assets/emailpassword/email-verification-successful.png" />

<div class="specialNote" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
Note that if you are already using SuperTokens in production and turn on email verification, your users will be redirected to the email verification screen next time they use your application.
